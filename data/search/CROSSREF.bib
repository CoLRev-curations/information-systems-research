   abstract                      = {Phishing is a significant security concern for organizations, threatening employees and members of the public. Phishing threats against employees can lead to severe security incidents, whereas those against the public can undermine trust, satisfaction, and brand equity. At the root of the problem is the inability of Internet users to identify phishing attacks even when using anti-phishing tools. We propose the phishing funnel model (PFM), a framework for predicting user susceptibility to phishing websites. PFM incorporates user, threat, and tool-related factors to predict actions during four key stages of the phishing process: visit, browse, consider legitimate, and intention to transact. We evaluated the efficacy of PFM in a 12-month longitudinal field experiment in two organizations involving 1,278 employees and 49,373 phishing interactions. PFM significantly outperformed competing models in terms of its ability to predict user susceptibility to phishing attacks. A follow-up three-month field study revealed that employees using PFM were significantly less likely to interact with phishing threats relative to comparison models and baseline warnings. Results of a cost-benefit analysis suggest that interventions guided by PFM could reduce annual phishing-related costs by nearly $1,900 per employee relative to comparison prediction methods.},

   abstract                      = {With peer-to-peer sharing of durable goods like cars, boats, and condominiums, it is unclear how manufacturers should react. They could seek to encourage these markets or compete against them by offering their own rentals. This work shows why the best business model depends on whether consumer usage rates vary or not. Contrary to what might be expected, this paper shows that manufacturers have an incentive to facilitate transactions of P2P rental markets in a large variety of cases. We find that when consumer variation in usage rates is intermediate, the manufacturer is surprisingly best off avoiding offering its own direct rentals option and instead, facilitating a peer-to-peer rental market where consumers can share among themselves. The reason for this is an effect unique to the sharing economy, the equalizing effect. The equalizing effect shows that peer-to-peer rentals uniquely make previously heterogeneous willingness-to-pay among consumers more similar, making it easier for the firm to discriminate between the higher- and lower-value consumers, thus allowing it to extract a higher portion of consumers’ surplus. Surprisingly, there are some cases where peer-to-peer rentals benefit the manufacturer, but consumers are hurt overall (though the lower-usage consumers do always benefit from the availability of peer-to-peer rentals).},

Learning about firm interactions from news is commonly done by human investors but has not been realized by automatic methods, leading to a research opportunity in market signaling via dynamic firm relations. This study proposes a new text-mining approach to extract cobenefit/counter-benefit networks based on firms’ mutual or conflicting interests in business events. It reveals that the extracted dynamic networks provide additional value in predicting firm equity value over current adopted supply chain and coindustry networks, after controlling for market activities and other traditional indicators from news, such as volume, sentiment, and comentions. In practice, such cobenefit/counter-benefit networks provide good buy and sell signals, which enrich known indicators and support more complex trading strategies in investment and portfolio management. The analysis and visualization of the extracted cobenefit/counter-benefit networks are also useful in understanding the structure of the economy and assessing firm/industry changes in a timelier fashion.},

   abstract                      = {Rapid growth in the cloud industry not only provides tremendous opportunities to cloud providers who have invested heavily in computing capacities, but also leads to low utilization of capacities at times. To alleviate this problem, some providers have launched a low-priority service with the so-called preemptible or spot instances, which allows them to reclaim capacities when necessary. This study focuses on an emerging market segment of customers with fault-tolerant computing jobs, who are the potential users of the preemptible instances. Through an analytical model that captures the underlying supply-demand dynamics, we examine a prevalent discount scheme, which provides all users the same discount, and its impact on key performance measures. Having realized that this is a relatively new market segment and there is room for improvement in discount-scheme designs, we propose an interruption-based discount scheme, which provides compensation to users based on the frequency of interruptions encountered by each of them. Our study suggests that the proposed scheme is fairer than the prevalent scheme from the customers’ perspective and that, in the presence of risk-averse customers, the cloud provider could be better off by adopting the proposed scheme when the supply of the surplus capacity is highly uncertain.},

What corporate leaders may not realize is that certain actions they are taking in the social responsibility space may, in fact, be placing a proverbial target on their backs. Indeed, there is evidence that the hacking community is not homogeneous, and at least some hackers from both internal and external sources appear to be motivated by what they dislike as opposed to solely financial gain. Recent hacks against the World Health Organization, as a result of its actions (or supposed inactions) related to the COVID-19 pandemic, are a case in point. In this paper, we put forth the idea that espoused positive social performance in areas that are peripheral to core business operations (e.g., philanthropy, recycling programs) can be a detriment to information security, particularly when firms have simultaneous high levels of social concerns (e.g., poor employee relations, product safety concerns, involvement in an environmental controversy). Our results support this outcome. It appears that some perpetrators can “sniff out” firm social actions that attempt to give the appearance of social responsibility and possibly mask poor social performance, and consequently, these firms are victimized by a malicious data breach more often.},

Yet opinions among economists about the returns to ICT, especially at the aggregate level, are divided. We exploit business-to-business transaction panel data from ICT producers to construct ICT capital stocks for a large sample of Belgian firms. This allows us to estimate the returns to ICT at the firm level and to investigate how firm-level ICT investments affected aggregate gross domestic product and productivity. We find large returns to ICT—more precisely, a firm investing an additional euro in ICT—increases value added by 1 euro and 35 cents on average. This marginal product of ICT investment increases with firm size and varies across sectors. Although we find substantial returns to ICT at the firm level, returns are much lower at the aggregate level. This is due to underinvestment in ICT (ICT capital deepening is low) and because firms with especially high returns are underinvesting.},

Although the effect of mobile money has been examined in the past, we look at the supply side effects as it is important for managers to understand the role of mobile money in both providing social good and making a profit. From 1G to 4G mobile technologies, mobile money consistently serves as a competitive advantage for mobile network operators (MNOs). However, this does not mean that the effect stays unchanged over the generations of mobile technology. Instead, when the 3G technology allows web browsing as a major upgrade of mobile functionality, MNOs with mobile money have a substantially larger set of options to differentiate from those without mobile money; and as a result, mobile money implemented with 3G and 4G leads to larger market shares than that with 1G and 2G.},

This research note studies “piggybacking”—expanding the focal market to recruit exclusive users from external networks—as a new and nonpricing control to launch platforms in conjunction with pricing controls. We first consider consumer-side piggybacking. Our results provide a rich set of novel insights into strategies that platforms use to monetize exclusive access to external users with nontrivial characterizations of the interplay among piggybacking, cross-side network effects, and price competition. We identify conditions when piggybacking is profit improving and when it leads to a prisoner’s dilemma, depending on the piggybacking cost and strengths of cross-side network effects. Among others, we show that piggybacking may intensify rather than ease price competition. We then consider provider-side piggybacking, and we show that the insights are qualitatively the same as consumer-side piggybacking except that the prisoner’s dilemma disappears if piggybacking providers multihome.},

   abstract                      = {This research examines the economic impact of membership-based free-shipping (MFS) programs when introduced as an augmentation to widely accepted contingent free-shipping (CFS) policies. Under CFS, consumers waive the shipping surcharge if the order exceeds a certain threshold, whereas under MFS, consumers pay an upfront fee and enjoy the free-shipping perk throughout the membership period. We develop a stylized model that considers consumer heterogeneity in two dimensions: (1) disutility from acquiring an auxiliary product—a product that consumers would not otherwise purchase—to qualify for CFS; and (2) shopping frequency over a given period. Our analysis suggests that the introduction of MFS allows the e-tailer to segment the market further, which could lead to a higher product price. When the disutility from acquiring an auxiliary product is moderate, the e-tailer should charge a high membership fee to target only frequent shoppers who forgo CFS. However, the e-tailer should lower the fee to lure also (1) frequent shoppers who would otherwise take CFS, when the disutility is high; or (2) infrequent shoppers who would otherwise forgo CFS, when the disutility is low. In all cases, although the collected fee revenue can never compensate for the cost arising from offering the free-shipping perk, the loss can be recouped as a desirable outcome of a more segmented market. Our research generates insights into the optimal design of e-tailers’ shipping policies, shedding light on the practical challenges that confront e-tailers.},

   abstract                      = {We study platform firms’ decision to recognize innovative products by complementors ex post through awards. We find that awards—despite being purely symbolic—might set incentives for complementors’ product strategies that can eventually lead to both desirable and undesirable outcomes for the platform firm. First, awards encourage recipients to focus on releasing complement improvements rather than new complements. Second, awards increases recipients’ likelihood of multihoming. Finally, awards increase new complement releases in the recipients’ market niche by attracting other complementors. Firms can directly benefit from the analyses presented in this study. For platform firms, this study’s results suggest that awards have significant effects on complementors’ behavior despite representing only symbolic and nonfinancial mechanisms. Platform managers should consider the flexibility of awards as a particular strength: an award can, for instance, be given to “the best complement” with no need to define the criteria exactly. Nevertheless, platform managers should be aware that employing awards requires a careful evaluation of whether their effects are desirable. Given that awards can encourage multihoming, platform managers are advised to employ additional mechanisms to increase recipients’ loyalty to the platform, for example, through contractual exclusivity arrangements.},

Using data from a crowd-lending platform, we show that, compared with portfolios created by crowds, a reasonably sophisticated machine can construct financial portfolios that provide better returns while controlling for risk. Further, we find that the machine-created portfolios benefit not only the lenders, but also the borrowers. Borrowers receive loans at a much lower interest rate as the machine can weed out the riskiest loans better than the crowds. We also find suggestive evidence of algorithmic bias in machine decisions. We find that, compared with women, men are more likely to receive loans by machine. We propose a general and effective “debiasing” method that can be applied to any prediction-focused machine learning (ML) applications. We show that the debiased ML algorithm, which suffers from lower prediction accuracy, still improves the crowd’s investment decisions in our context. Our results indicate that ML can help crowd-lending platforms better fulfill the promise of providing access to financial resources to otherwise underserved individuals and ensure fairness in the allocation of these resources.},

We present the first empirical evidence of the positive influence of online education crowdfunding after teachers successfully raise funds. Using data from California public school teachers and their students, as well as the teachers’ fundraising activities on DonorsChoose.org , we find significant academic performance improvements among students after their teachers receive donations through this platform. Such improvements in students’ academic performance are stronger when more local donors participate in teachers’ fundraising campaigns. Notably, teachers who attempt to raise funds online but are unsuccessful are still able to improve their students’ performance. These findings not only document the positive impact of online education crowdfunding on students’ academic performance, but also demonstrate that such impacts are at least partially attributable to the nonfinancial motivational benefits on teachers from receiving such donations. Our study therefore contributes to the literature on crowdfunding, as well as the ongoing debates surrounding the financing of public education.},

Many crowdfunding platforms have started using robo-advisors to help lenders augment their intelligence in P2P loan investments. Collaborating with one of the leading P2P companies, we examine how investors use robo-advisors and how the human adjustment of robo-advisor usage affects investment performance. Our analyses show that, somewhat surprisingly, investors who need more help from robo-advisors—that is, those encountered more defaults in their manual investing—are less likely to adopt such services. Investors tend to adjust their usage of the service in reaction to recent robo-advisor performance. However, interestingly, these human-in-the-loop interferences often lead to inferior performance.},

   abstract                      = {Although retailers recognize the potential value of sharing transactional data with supply chain partners, many remain reluctant to share. However, there is evidence that the extent of sharing would be greater if information sensitive to retailers can be concealed before sharing. Extant research has only considered sensitive information at the organizational level. This is rarely the case in reality; the retail industry has adapted their offerings to region-wide differences in customer tastes for decades. Differences in customer characteristics across regions lead to region-specific sensitive information in addition to any at the organizational level. This is the first paper to propose an approach to solve this version of the problem. Region-level requirements increase the size of an already difficult (NP-hard) problem substantially, making adaptations of existing approaches impractical. We present an ensemble approach that draws intuition from Lagrangian relaxation to conceal sensitive patterns at the organizational and regional levels with minimal damage to the data set. Extensive computational experiments show that it identifies optimal or near-optimal solutions even when other approaches fail, doing so without any loss in recommendation effectiveness. This mitigates potential risks associated with sharing and should increase data sharing among partners in the supply chain.},

This study examines how backers respond to the lottery—a type of probabilistic uncertain reward—and how their motivations shape their responses to probabilistic uncertain rewards. Using data collected from a reward-based crowdfunding platform, we find that although the lottery helps to attract a higher number of backers on a crowdfunding project, the lottery also reduces the total money raised by the project and thus the probability of reaching its funding goal. Specifically, although the lottery incentivizes individuals who would otherwise not fund the project to become (small) lottery backers, the lottery also cannibalizes regular prospective rewardees and donors by encouraging them to opt for the (cheaper) lottery option. Second, the effects of the lottery are stronger in the earlier stages of a project’s fundraising cycle. Third, the lottery has larger effects on backers with higher prior tendencies to be donors than rewardees. Notably, from a practical standpoint, our study informs fundraisers on how to design strategies to attract the right type of backers and crowdfunding platform managers on how to leverage the lottery as a type of probabilistic uncertain reward on crowdfunding platforms.},

   abstract                      = {The virtualization of every aspect of our life does not mean that old ways of social interaction can now be transported to the internet. According to recent research conducted on the influence of mobile apps, we also need to look at how digital spaces enable interactions among individuals. We use large-scale geospatial data analysis to study millions of postings in an app called Waze. We conceptualize a novel factor called virtual crowdedness, which is the density of usage of the app in a specific neighborhood. We find that displaying the density of a user’s “virtual activities” can both encourage and discourage participation by the entire community. We find that participation in virtual settings is akin to what economists describe as a public good, where only a few individuals contribute but create well-being for the entire community. Users’ motivation to participate in virtual settings depends on what is termed “impure altruism” by economists, where participation is heavily influenced by motives of prestige and public recognition. These motivations are reinforced through intensive social interactions among members of such communities. We also find there is a strong bystander effect in these virtual communities. The bystander effect refers to the phenomenon in which an individual’s likelihood of engaging in a helpful act decreases when bystanders are present in a critical situation.},

We argue that DSB risk cannot be mitigated by one executive alone, but, rather, is a shared leadership responsibility of the top management team (TMT) (i.e., Chief Executive Officer [CEO], Chief Financial Officer [CFO], and Chief Information Officer [CIO]). Our results suggest that IT-savvy CEOs see technologies related to mitigating DSBs as a top-three most important type of digital methodology for their firm. Similarly, the results related to CFOs with IT expertise single out the critical investment in controls designed to prevent DSBs. Our strong findings for CIOs on the TMT add to the related guidance from COBIT 5 for information security and consistently suggest that they are the key executive for securing IT systems. Finally, our granular explanation of each executive’s DSB-related responsibility could potentially provide firms the start of a governance-led roadmap for compliance to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s and Justice Department’s cyber regulations.},

Both content characteristics and creator characteristics have been examined for their influence on virality. But the relationships between them are rarely discussed. We propose an extension to our existing conceptual framework to study the interactions between content and creator variables. And we demonstrate the significance of the interactions using data from 800,000 tweets. We find that by adding content-–creator interactions, the predictive power of the model improves significantly, which underlines the importance of the interactions for studying virality in social media. We also provide insights for managers on shaping their social media presence and strategy to use social media popularity for marketing and brand building.},

In this study, we provide data-driven insights to managers by empirically investigating the impact of a platform owner’s entry on the demand of third-party stores and their potential reactions using transaction level data from a large e-commerce platform. Contrary to previous studies in mobile app platforms, our study shows that the demand of competing third-party stores decreases with the entry of the platform, especially for large third-party stores. We further show that the demand reduction is significant only in the offline channel and the reduction results from third-party stores’ defensive strategy to divert their offline customers away from the platform (i.e., disintermediation). Our findings indicate that platforms should carefully evaluate the nature of their markets before entering the market to compete with complementors, because they may lead third-party sellers to disintermediate from the platform. On the other hand, from the perspective of third-party sellers, disintermediation might be an overreaction to the entry of the platform, because their online demand is not significantly affected by platform entry based on our analyses.},

   abstract                      = {The growing ubiquity of GPS-enabled smartphones has ushered in a new era of location-based services and online-to-offline commerce. Geofencing is one instance of this broader phenomenon, and it is being widely adopted in the context of retail, restaurant, entertainment, and other local services. By targeting users on mobile apps while they are in the vicinity of physical establishments, there is potential for higher levels of engagement and consumption of the products or services on offer. However, the level of consumer interest is likely to depend on distance from the establishment and local competition in the surrounding areas. This study examines the impact of these two factors on consumer response to geofence advertising at different points in the purchase funnel, namely the click stage and conversion phase. Analyzing a rich data set from one of the leading location-based marketing agencies and using a sophisticated Bayesian empirical methodology, we find that having one more competitor in the consumer’s vicinity reduces click-through rate by about 1%, and a 1-mile increase in distance is associated with a 17.6% reduction in conversion rate. These and other results suggest that accounting for distance and local competition in data-analytic mobile targeting would increase both the return on advertising spend and consumer welfare.},

We examine how prior research has incorporated context in theorizing and develop a framework to classify existing approaches to contextualization. In addition, we expound on a decomposition approach to contextualization and put forth a set of guidelines for developing context-specific models. We illustrate the application of the guidelines by constructing and comparing various context-specific variations of the technology acceptance model (TAM)—i.e., the decomposed TAM that incorporates interaction effects between context-specific factors, the extended TAM with context-specific antecedents, and the integrated TAM that incorporates mediated moderation and moderated mediation effects of context-specific factors. We tested the models on 972 individuals in two technology usage contexts: a digital library and an agile Web portal. The results show that the decomposed TAM provides a better understanding of the contexts by revealing the direct and interaction effects of context-specific factors on behavioral intention that are not mediated by the TAM constructs of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. This work contributes to the ongoing discussion about the importance of context in theory development and provides guidance for context-specific theorizing in IS research.},

We propose the effect of workers’ use of the direct messaging system on employers’ hiring decisions and conceptualize the information role of direct messaging. To empirically evaluate the information role of the direct messaging system, we leverage data on the direct messaging activities between workers and employers across more than 470,000 job applications on a leading online labor market. We report evidence that direct messaging with a prospective employer increases a worker’s probability of being hired by 8.9%. However, the degree to which workers benefit from direct messaging is heterogeneous, and the effect amplifies for workers approaching employers from a position of disadvantage (lacking tenure or fit with the job) and attenuates as more workers attempt to message the same prospective employer. The effects also depend on message content. In particular, we find that the benefits of direct messaging for workers depend a great deal on the politeness of the workers, and this “politeness effect” depends on several contextual factors. The beneficial effects are amplified for lower-status workers (i.e., workers lacking tenure and job fit) and workers who share a common language with the employer. At the same time, the beneficial effects weaken in the presence of typographical errors. These findings provide important insights into when and what to message to achieve favorable hiring outcomes in online employment settings.},

Unlike captive computing resources, cloud computing occurs as a pay-as-you-go contract, similar to the provision of electricity. We develop a method to reduce the rental cost of completing a given computing task with a certain deadline. The current practice is to use a single computing resource that can get the task done in the cheapest possible manner. Instead, costs can be significantly reduced if the task is switched between multiple resources, some more powerful and others less powerful. We apply our method to a real computing task at Cidewalk and show that costs can be significantly reduced.},

The gig economy has low barriers to entry, enabling flexible work arrangements and allowing workers to engage in contingent employment, whenever, and in some cases, such as online labor markets, wherever, workers desire. And many of the workers seek and complete work via digital platforms. However, there is a lack of understanding into the participation in such platforms. The growth of the gig economy has been partly attributed to technological advancements that enable flexible work environments. In this study, we consider the role of an alternative driver, economic downturns, and associated financial stressors in the offline economy, for example, unemployment. Our analysis combines data from a leading online labor market and various archival sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We find local economic conditions significantly impact the intensive and extensive margins of labor supply in online labor markets. And such impacts are heterogeneous across different county characteristics. Given the prominence of the gig economy, we believe more research is needed to understand gig-economy participation. It is notable that policy makers recently started to look at related issues, proposing laws to protect the gig workers, such as the recent California Assembly Bill 5.},

   abstract                      = {Monitoring and contract renegotiation are two common solutions for addressing information asymmetry and uncertainty between a client and a vendor of software outsourcing services. Monitoring is mostly applied in time-and-materials contracts, as a basis for inspecting and reimbursing the vendor’s efforts in system development. Renegotiation, by contrast, is deployed in fixed-price and time-and-materials contracts to mitigate the loss of surplus from uncertainty after system development. We investigate the interaction between monitoring and renegotiation and examine the corresponding contract choice problem. We find that the client benefits from renegotiation based on two effects: an uncertainty-resolution effect and a post-development incentive effect, which incentivizes the vendor to exert additional effort in system development. Monitoring does not resolve uncertainty, although it does encourage the vendor to exert additional effort, a pre-development incentive effect. Our analysis shows that the choice of renegotiation or monitoring depends on the interactions of the above effects, which are moderated by the renegotiation cost, monitoring cost, and bargaining power in renegotiation. When renegotiation cost is low: if the client has high bargaining power and low monitoring cost, monitoring and renegotiation are complements and both are selected; otherwise, the two instruments are substitutes and contract renegotiation is preferred. When renegotiation cost is high: monitoring substitutes for renegotiation and the client only chooses monitoring if the cost to do it is low; or else neither is used. Overall, this research shows that four appropriate contract strategies should be used under somewhat different circumstances. We further analyze the impacts of some other key aspects of software outsourcing and extend the base model to address two alternative situations to show the robustness of our findings. The results apply to a range of software reliability growth models, including when machine learning or cloud computing are used.},

In the first stage, we build a hidden Markov model to capture how gamers' latent engagement state evolves as a function of their game-play experience and outcome and the relationship between their engagement state and game-play behavior. We estimate the model using a data set containing detailed information on 1,309 randomly sampled gamers' playing histories over 29 months. We find that high-, medium-, and low-engagement-state gamers respond differently to motivations, such as feelings of achievement and need for challenge. For example, a higher per-period total score (achievement) increases the engagement of gamers in a low or high engagement state but not those in a medium engagement state; gamers in a low or medium engagement state enjoy within-period score variation (challenge), but those in a high engagement state do not. In the second stage, we develop a matching algorithm that learns (predicts) the gamer's current engagement state on the fly and exploits that learning to match the gamer to a round to maximize game-play. Our algorithm increases gamer game-play volume and frequency by 4%–8% conservatively, leading to economically significant revenue gains for the company.},

This research shows that the game currency exchange rate (e.g., $1 = 1,000 game currency is a higher rate than $1 = 10 game currency) affects price perception of virtual items. When the rate is not prominent in players’ minds (e.g., the rate is not mentioned or players have sufficient game currency in their account), players consider a virtual item as more expensive if the rate is higher. In contrast, when the rate is prominent in players’ minds (e.g., the rate is mentioned and no additional information indicates that players already have sufficient game currency, and thus it is irrelevant), players consider a virtual item as cheaper if the rate is higher. In the latter case, higher rate leads to stronger purchase intention of nonsocial, but not social, virtual items. Our findings show currency system design can affect players’ willingness to spend on virtual items thus affecting the revenue of game operators. Moreover, reminders of the actual monetary value of virtual items might help to reduce players’ overspending driven by the biasing effect of the game currency exchange rate.},

   abstract                      = {Online commerce websites often request users to register in the online shopping process. Recognizing the challenges of user registration, many websites opt to delay their registration request until the end of the conversion funnel (i.e., ex post registration request). A new study in Information Systems Research explores an alternative approach by asking users to register with the website at the beginning of their shopping journey (i.e., ex ante registration request). The authors of the study, Ni Huang (University of Houston), Probal Mojumder (University of Southern California), Tianshu Sun (University of Southern California), Jinchi Lv (University of Southern California), and Joseph M. Golden (Collage.com), show that the ex ante request leads to an increased probability of user registration. Furthermore, the ex ante request leads to considerable increases in customer purchases in the long run and does not significantly influence sales in the short run. Further investigation into the long-term and short-term effects provides suggestive evidence on several potential mechanisms, such as firm-initiated interaction (e.g., email marketing campaigns) and screening of low-interest users (i.e., users with low initial valuations of the website and in a potentially disengaged state). This study provides managerial implications on the design of user-registration systems in e-commerce websites.},

   abstract                      = {Massive online open courses (MOOCs) are a booming phenomenon in the digital era. However, the online nature of educational delivery via MOOCs creates every opportunity for digital distraction and procrastination, resulting in difficulties for students and instructors. According to a new study in Information Systems Research, the authors Ni Huang (University of Houston), Jiayin Zhang (Tsinghua University), Gordon Burtch (University of Minnesota), Xitong Li (HEC Paris), and Peiyu Chen (Arizona State University) report a randomized field experiment on a large MOOC platform to examine several calls to action (CTAs) pertaining to the completion and submission of course assignments with an eye toward combating student procrastination on MOOCs. Their results show that descriptive norms (i.e., informing the completion rates of the assignments) lead to higher probabilities of assignment completion and a shorter time to completion. In contrast, a deadline reminder in the form of a planning prompt (i.e., informing the target deadline for assignment submission and the importance of planning ahead) has a surprisingly counterproductive effect, in particular, if students’ active course load is low. One possible explanation is that the students with low course loads may perceive the deadline to be distant, which reduces their sense of urgency and leads to complacency.},

Notably, applications of IA are beginning to emerge in several domains, such as cybersecurity, privacy, counterterrorism, and healthcare, among others. We provide a brief summary of papers in this special section that represent early attempts to address some of the rapidly emerging research issues.

   abstract                      = {Lending-based real estate crowdfunding, which involves the use of real estate to secure loans, has emerged as a promising alternative with lower risk than peer-to-peer lending. This study provides insights into understanding how lenders’ investment behavior is shaped by various information in such an emerging market. Using a data set from a large platform over 17 months, the authors find that lenders as a whole prefer loans secured by a borrower’s house to those secured by a mortgage, as reflected in quicker and larger lending transactions. Experienced lenders tend to invest more aggressively, in both time and amount, but exhibit a weaker preference for loans secured by a borrower’s house. A rise in housing prices is associated with quicker lending decisions, and this association is found to be stronger for loans secured by a borrower’s house. When stock market volatility is large, lenders tend to slow down their investments; such a tendency is attenuated for loans secured by a mortgage. The authors suggest that lender heterogeneity in responding to different collateral types should be incorporated into the platform’s design of an automatic transaction or a recommender system. Moreover, platform managers should consider economic conditions at the macro level when deploying their marketing strategy.},

   abstract                      = {Crowdsourcing is a new way for online crowds to get involved in a company’s research and development process. Businesses can host public contests on online platforms (such as Kaggle, Topcoder, and Tongal) to seek new product ideas and technological solutions. In the contest communities, members usually have a “coopetitive” relationship: they compete against each other for the contest prize, while at the same time also cooperate with each other by sharing information and knowledge. This work investigates the effect of knowledge sharing in such crowdsourcing contests. Surprisingly, we find that the knowledge sharing process may not always help improve crowdsourcing contestants’ performance. The effectiveness of knowledge sharing is influenced by the volume, quality, and generativity of shared knowledge. Shared knowledge is only beneficial when it is of high quality or when it has high potential of being further developed collectively by the community. Meanwhile, the development process has to be diverging; narrowing the development process in one direction can restrict the community creativity and negatively influence crowdsourcing performance. Our work informs the crowdsourcing practitioners to be more cautious when they enable collaboration such as knowledge sharing for the contest community.},

   abstract                      = {Systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly support physicians in diagnostic decisions, but they are not without errors and biases. Failure to detect those may result in wrong diagnoses and medical errors. Compared with rule-based systems, however, these systems are less transparent and their errors less predictable. Thus, it is difficult, yet critical, for physicians to carefully evaluate AI advice. This study uncovers the cognitive challenges that medical decision makers face when they receive potentially incorrect advice from AI-based diagnosis systems and must decide whether to follow or reject it. In experiments with 68 novice and 12 experienced physicians, novice physicians with and without clinical experience as well as experienced radiologists made more inaccurate diagnosis decisions when provided with incorrect AI advice than without advice at all. We elicit five decision-making patterns and show that wrong diagnostic decisions often result from shortcomings in utilizing metacognitions related to decision makers’ own reasoning (self-monitoring) and metacognitions related to the AI-based system (system monitoring). As a result, physicians fall for decisions based on beliefs rather than actual data or engage in unsuitably superficial evaluation of the AI advice. Our study has implications for the training of physicians and spotlights the crucial role of human actors in compensating for AI errors.},

   abstract                      = {Enterprise system users are required to improve competence to gain the system’s value. The development of user competence to effectively use a complex system is socially constructed. Based on the job demands-resources model, we propose and empirically validate how two types of work contextual factors, namely, job demands and job resources, are directly and interactively related to user competence. Results of a longitudinal survey from users in six organizations suggest that all three job resource factors considered—leader–member exchange, traditional support structures, and peer support structure—allow users to acquire both the technical and business knowledge needed for effective application of the system for work. But, work overload, as the job demand factor, has no significant effect on user competence. Further analysis shows the relationship between work overload and user competence is moderated by leader–member exchange, but not the two support structures. Our findings are of great importance for practice, as they suggest job resources are conducive to the development of user competence, whereas work overload is an inevitable, acute problem.},

   abstract                      = {Online reviews are a crucial source of information for consumer decision making. Many businesses, companies, and platforms are interested in encouraging more consumers to review their products but are dubious about using financial incentives to buy online reviews. Our research describes a social way of growing online reviews. We show that cultivating an online community for reviewing by showing members reviews written by their online friends cannot only increasing their willingness to contribute but also the quality of the resulting reviews. The takeaways of this study include (1) unlike using financial rewards to incentivize review contribution, the studied approach can motivate review contributions without compromising the quality of reviews contributed; (2) the effect of exposing consumers to their friends’ reviews is comparable to that of Yelp’s weekly newsletters (thus this can be a powerful way of motivating consumer reviews); and (3) to effectively leverage friend reviews, online platforms should facilitate social networking among users and build an online community that recognizes and rewards members who make frequent, high-quality contributions to online reviews.},

Three years ago I wrote an editorial for the first issue that set the tone and immediate goals for the journal, summarized as follows: “ISR has established itself as one of a small set of top-tier academic journals in the information systems discipline. Editorial policy changes have been designed to strengthen a number of aspects of the journal, particularly the timeliness of the work published, without having a negative impact on the journal's reputation for publishing high-quality work” (ISR website 2002). Looking back at the past three years, these goals have been met—we have decreased turnaround time by more than 50%, and the journal's ratings are as strong as (or stronger than) they were before. In this editorial note I will highlight our current processes and provide some data regarding the journal's progress over the last three years.},

What is the special ingredient in this industry that would incentivize a manufacturer to give tacit approval to buying and selling used games? In this study, leveraging a game-theoretic model, we investigate the effect of gaming console on a manufacturer’s strategy in the presence of a secondhand market for games. We find that when the manufacturer offers a console that provides additional value outside of playing games (e.g., media hub with apps), the secondhand market improves the manufacturer’s profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare, all at the same time. Moreover, the manufacturer enjoys greater benefit from the secondhand market as the intrinsic value of the console increases. This is in stark contrast with cases where there are no consoles involved or the consoles do not offer any intrinsic value; in such settings, the manufacturer would opt to shut down the secondhand market. Overall, our results have implications that apply not only to the past and present of the gaming industry but also to its future and to other types of platform-based markets for contents.},

   abstract                      = {In today's competitive environment, an increasing number of firms are building common information systems, which will be deployed globally, to support their strategic globalization initiatives. These systems are designed to meet the requirements of a diverse set of stakeholders with different business needs, priorities, and objectives. One managerial tool for addressing and reconciling such differences is control, which encompasses all attempts to motivate individuals to act in a manner that is consistent with organizational objectives. This paper examines two research questions. How do stakeholders exercise control during different phases of large IS projects? Why do control choices change across project phases? Results of two case studies suggest control is exercised differently for each phase. During the initial phase of a project, control is exercised as “collective sensemaking,” in which both IS and business stakeholders utilize mostly informal mechanisms of control. During development, “technical winnowing” of mechanisms occurs such that control is vested primarily in IS managers, who structure hierarchical relationships with subordinates and who rely extensively on formal control mechanisms. Both IS and business stakeholders employ formal and informal mechanisms during implementation to exercise control as “collaborative coordinating.” The results also suggest that changes in control choices from one project phase to another are triggered by factors in the project, stakeholder, and global contexts. As factors change across phases, so too do control choices. Further, problems that surface in one project phase trigger changes to controls in subsequent phases. These findings are integrated into a model of the dynamics of control. Implications of these results are drawn, and directions for future research are suggested.},

   abstract                      = {Information technology (IT) outsourcing success requires careful management of customer-supplier relationships. However, there are few published studies on the ongoing relationships, and most of these adopt a customer perspective, de-emphasizing suppliers. In this study, we look at both customer and supplier perspectives, by means of the psychological contract of customer and supplier project managers. We apply the concept of psychological contract to perceived mutual obligations, and to how such fulfillment of obligations can predict success. Our research questions are (1) What are the critical customer-supplier obligations in an IT outsourcing relationship? and (2) What is the impact of fulfilling these obligations on success? We use a sequential, qualitative-quantitative approach to develop and test our model. In the qualitative study, we probe the nature of customer-supplier obligations using in-depth interviews. Content analysis of interview transcripts show that both customers and suppliers identify six obligations that are critical to success. Customers perceive supplier obligations to be accurate project scoping, clear authority structures, taking charge, effective human capital management, effective knowledge transfer, and effective interorganizational teams. Suppliers perceive customer obligations as clear specifications, prompt payment, close project monitoring, dedicated project staffing, knowledge sharing, and project ownership. In the second quantitative study, we assess the impact of fulfilling these obligations on success through a field study of 370 managers. Results show that fulfilled obligations predict success over and above the effects of contract type, duration, and size.},

This article presents a new reputation framework that combines human input with machine learning to provide dynamic, multidimensional, and skill-set-specific quality assessments. The framework significantly outperforms current reputation systems. By providing more representative reputation scores, the framework helps workers to differentiate, employers to make informed decisions, and the market to improve its recommendation algorithms and understand the supply distributions across different dimensions. The framework generalizes in other contexts where reputation systems are overly positive and unidimensional. The framework highlights how combining human input with advanced machine learning techniques can augment intelligence by creating the necessary conditions for humans to make informed decisions. Such systems have the potential to increase efficiency and outcome quality precisely because they intelligently differentiate workers. The deployment of the proposed intelligence augmentation framework in different types of online platforms could have implications for workers, employers, businesses, and the future of work.},

Our research examines increases and decreases of types of user engagement in online communities, characterizing user engagement based on trace user activity or lack of activity. Some lurkers later become workers (i.e., engaged in the community), but some will not. Differentiating lurkers who can be engaged from those who cannot enables managers to anticipate and proactively direct their resources toward the users who are most likely to become or remain workers (i.e., heavy contributors), thereby promoting community welfare. Our research, based on analysis of 533,714 posts from an online diabetes community, can thus guide managerial interventions to increase online community welfare.},

To do so, we study two events that removed and then partially restored access to online music videos for consumers in Germany. Because of a legal dispute, virtually all music videos were blocked from YouTube, which led to a decrease in record sales of about 5%–10%. When the dedicated platform Vevo entered a few years later, record sales increased again by a similar amount. This is effect can be attributed to user-generated content (fan videos and cover versions) as much as to official music videos. Record sales of newcomer artists and mainstream music benefit disproportionally. We discuss the implications for debates on the reform of compulsory licensing rules and copyright.},

   abstract                      = {To inform product release and distribution strategies, research has analyzed cross-market spillovers in new product adoption. However, models that examine these effects for digital and viral media are still evolving. Given resistance to advertising, firms often seek to promote their own viral content to boost brand awareness. However, a key shortcoming of virality is its ephemeral nature. To gain insight into sustaining virality, we develop a quasi-experimental approach that estimates the backward spillover onto a focal platform by introducing a piece of content onto a new platform. We posit that introducing content to the audience of a new platform can generate word of mouth, which may affect its consumption within an earlier platform. We estimate these spillovers using data on 381 viral videos on 26 platforms (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo) and observe how consumption of videos on an initial “lead” platform is affected by their subsequent introduction onto “lag” platforms. This spillover is estimated as follows: for each multiplatform video, we compare its view growth after being introduced onto a new platform to that of a synthetic control based on similar single-platform videos. Analysis of 275 such spillover scenarios reveals that introducing a video onto a lag platform roughly doubles its subsequent view growth in the lead platform. This positive cross-platform spillover is persistent, bursty, and strongest in the first 42 days. We find that spillover is boosted when the video is consumed more in the lag platform, when the consumption rate peaks earlier in the lag platform, and when the lag platform targets a foreign market. Our findings suggest that firms can sustain the popularity of their viral content by introducing it onto additional platforms (e.g., Vimeo) after posting it on a focal platform (e.g., YouTube). As a result of their posting on the latter platforms, firms can expect subsequent view growth on the focal platform to roughly double. The aforementioned benefits persists for up to five lag platforms. Platforms should also consider that a positive cross-platform spillover may help platforms reinforce each other’s usage, rather than cannibalize each other.},

The existing research in display advertising has predominantly concentrated on the content of advertising; however, our focus is on optimizing the timing of display advertising. In practice, users are constantly adjusting their engagement with content as they process new information continuously. The recent development of emotional tracking and wearable technologies allows platforms to monitor the user’s engagement in real time. The proposed optimal policy regarding the timing of behavioral advertising is based on a threshold policy with a trigger threshold and target level. Analogous to the familiar idea of “price discrimination,” the methods we propose in this study allow the platforms to maximize their revenue by “discriminatory” customization of the timing and length of the advertisement based on the behavior of individual users. Finally, we quantify the benefits of the proposed policy by comparing it with the practically prevalent policies (i.e., preroll, midroll, and a mix of the two) through a simulation study. Our results reveal that, for a wide range of settings, the proposed policy not only significantly increases the platform’s profitability but also improves the completion rate at which consumers finish viewing the advertisement.},

However, whereas the resulting loss of jobs has been shown to have many negative consequences for the affected individuals, it may also push them into new activities, such as provision of service to their communities. In this paper, we show how individuals engage in socially useful activities after an increase in unemployment. Specifically, we document increased online content generation at Wikipedia, the world’s largest user-generated knowledge repository. Leveraging German district-level and European country-level unemployment data, we analyze the relationship between the economic crisis in 2008–2010 and contributions to Wikipedia. We find increased socially valuable activity in the form of knowledge acquisition and contributions to Wikipedia. For German districts, we observe an increase in the rate of content generation on Wikipedia in more severely affected districts. These effects are even stronger at the European country level. Our findings suggest that public goods provision increases as a positive side effect of economic crises. We stress that similar patterns could apply to other digital content platforms. Under the backdrop that the potential value of the outcome of online volunteering and its societal impact is expected to grow drastically in the next years, we show that platforms could benefit from negative economic conditions in attracting volunteers. Moreover, in the coming years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence will call for a rise of online volunteering platforms. Therefore, the potential value of the outcome of online volunteering and its societal impact is expected to grow drastically in the next years.},

   abstract                      = {We study the spillover effects of the online reviews of other covisited products on the purchases of a focal product using clickstream data from a large retailer. The proposed spillover effects are moderated by (a) whether the related (covisited) products are complementary or substitutive, (b) the choice of media channel (mobile or personal computer (PC)) used, (c) whether the related products are from the same or a different brand, (d) consumer experience, and (e) the variance of the review ratings. To identify complementary and substitutive products, we develop supervised machine-learning models based on product characteristics, such as product category and brand, and novel text-based similarity measures. We train and validate the machine-learning models using product pair labels from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results show that the mean rating of substitutive (complementary) products has a negative (positive) effect on purchasing of the focal product. Interestingly, the magnitude of the spillover effects of the mean ratings of covisited (substitutive and complementary) products is significantly larger than the effects on the focal product, especially for complementary products. The spillover effect of ratings is stronger for consumers who use mobile devices versus PCs. We find the negative effect of the mean ratings of substitutive products across different brands on purchasing of a focal product to be significantly higher than within the same brand. Lastly, the effect of the mean ratings is stronger for less experienced consumers and for ratings with lower variance. We discuss implications on leveraging the spillover effect of the online product reviews of related products to encourage online purchases.},

Do women get an equal lift in their promotion prospects from performance improvements, work experience, and training as men? These are pertinent and important questions affecting today’s IT human capital. We analyze data from a leading IT services firm using robust econometric techniques to suggest that, contrary to expectations, women are more likely to be promoted. Although we do not find any evidence of overt discrimination, our findings, however, are far more nuanced and imply that there may be covert discrimination against women in IT when it comes to promotions: compared with men, women realize less benefit from performance gains than men, less benefit from tenure within the focal firm, but more benefit from training. Although our analysis is limited to the lower rungs of the organizational hierarchy, we propose several actionable managerial and policy insights that can potentially make IT firms more inclusive and attractive to women: more parity in the effect of performance improvements and work experience on promotions and using training as a signaling mechanism that can identify and encourage stellar women as they navigate the promotional ladder in IT firms.},

Contrastingly, this study uncovered the hidden truth that many book consumers post assessments before, during, and after consumption. Interestingly, many provide numerical review ratings, even with no consumption at all. We also found that review comments formed after incomplete product engagement adversely affect subsequent sales. Consequently, online evaluations crafted on the basis of fragmentary encounters can become a new source of challenges to managers and policymakers who are responsible for preserving the accuracy and informativeness of product critiques. Digital platforms may leverage our findings to improve their design of review systems and policies in ways that enhance the trustworthiness of peer evaluations and correct potential inaccuracies from inadequately informed assessments. For example, managers can revise their review “sorting” structure so that consumers can flexibly reposition text-based reviews in accordance with a consumption index. Managers can likewise take advantage of these study’s insights to effectively re-establish review-posting policies and schemes that encourage consumers to submit reviews after a sufficient amount of products have been consumed.},

Similar to the case of recommender systems, the challenge is how apps can be recommended to the right users and how consumers can find the right apps. This paper studies a new mobile app ad framework, cross-promotion (CP), which is to promote new “target” apps within other “source” apps. With unique random matching experiment data, we empirically test the important determinants of ad effectiveness. We then propose a machine-learning-based framework to optimally match source apps to target apps to improve ad effectiveness in terms of app downloads and postdownload usages. The simulation results show that app analytics capability is essential in building accurate prediction models and in increasing ad effectiveness of CP campaigns and that, at the expense of privacy, individual user data can further improve the matching performance. The paper has important managerial implications because it provides direct guidance to better utilize CP for app developers and to leverage data analytics and machine-learning models for platform managers. It also provides policy implications on the trade-off between utility and privacy in the growing data economy.},

   abstract                      = {Axiomatic Theories and Improving the Relevance of Information Systems Research This paper examines the fact that a significant number of empirical information systems (IS) studies engage in confirmative testing of self-evident axiomatic theories without yielding highly relevant knowledge for the IS community. The authors conduct both a horizontal analysis of 72 representative IS theories and an in-depth vertical analysis of 3 well-known theories (i.e., technology acceptance model, diffusion of innovation theory, and institutional theory) in order to measure how pervasive such testing of axiomatic theories is. The authors discovered that more than 60% of 666 hypotheses from the horizontal analysis could be regarded as axiomatic theory elements. In the vertical analysis, 68.1% of 1,301 hypotheses from 148 articles were axiomatic. Based on these findings, the authors propose four complementary IS research approaches: (1) identifying disconfirming boundary conditions, (2) measuring the relative importance of axiomatic causal factors, (3) measuring the stage of progression toward visionary goals when the nature of the axiomatic theory can be extended to future visions, and (4) engaging in the conceptual design of visionary axiomatic goals. They argue that these complementary IS research approaches can enhance the relevance of IS research outcomes without sacrificing methodological rigor.},

This paper explores how, why, and when reviewers’ attentional focus can influence the helpfulness evaluation of reviews beyond the impact of substantive review content. Drawing on the attentional focus and persuasion literatures, we develop a theoretical model proposing that reviewers’ attentional focus may influence consumers’ perception of review helpfulness through opposing processes, and that its overall effect is contingent on the review’s two-sidedness. Results of one archival analysis and five controlled experiments provide consistent support for our hypotheses. This work challenges the predominant view of the positive impact of other-focus (vs. self-focus), explores the interpersonal impact of a reviewer’s attentional focus on prospective consumers who are total strangers, and reveals an important, context-specific boundary condition.},

   abstract                      = {In this paper, we propose a two-step data-analytic approach to the promotion planning for mobile applications (apps). In the first step, we use historical sales data to estimate the app demand model and quantify the effect of price promotions on download volume. The estimation results reveal two interesting characteristics of the relationship between price promotion and download volume of mobile apps: (1) the magnitude of the direct immediate promotion effect is declining within a multiday promotion; and (2) due to the visibility effect (i.e., apps ranked high on the download chart are more visible to consumers), a price promotion also has an indirect effect on download volume by affecting app rank, and this effect can persist after the promotion ends. Based on the empirically estimated demand model, we propose a moving planning window heuristic to construct a promotion policy. Our heuristic promotion policy consists of shorter and more frequent promotions. We show that the proposed policy can increase the app lifetime revenue by around 10%.},

This perceived benefit of XBRL has prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to mandate that public firms must submit financial statements in the XBRL format as part of their financial reports. Leveraging the research opportunity created by the XBRL mandate, we examine whether financial reporting technologies affect how firms construct textual disclosures. We find that the initial adopters’ HTML-formatted annual reports become harder to read after the XBRL mandate. Further analysis reveals that this effect is concentrated among adopters with more quantitative disclosures, a smaller firm size, or a higher level of financial complexity. Importantly, we show that managers’ reduced attention to preparing HTML-formatted annual reports, rather than increased disclosures, is likely the explanation for this decrease in textual readability. We also find that the negative effect on textual readability persists at least in the subsequent year. Our findings suggest that the XBRL adopters need to pay attention to process optimization and technology enablement to mitigate the possible negative effect of XBRL adoption on the readability of financial reports.},

The empirical evidence, however, is contradictory: monetary incentives are shown to either increase or decrease contribution. We make the first attempt to build a unified theoretical model to understand the complex nature of the impact of monetary incentives. We consider contributors differentiated not only by their attitudes toward monetary incentives but also by their effectiveness to attract audience. We identify two scenarios where contributors can be crowded out when monetary incentives are present: (1) when a small amount of monetary incentive is introduced, the non–money-driven contributors reduce or even stop contributing (motivation crowding out); or (2) when the monetary incentive is relatively large, the high-effectiveness contributors crowd out the low-effectiveness ones (competition crowding out). As a result, an increase in the monetary incentive can either increase or decrease contributors’ participation and the total content volume contributed. Our results offer guidelines for different UGC platforms to design monetary incentive mechanisms.},

Based on our analysis, we would recommend that e-retailing firms choose the flexible contracts, which give them the flexibility of adjusting their advertising spending during the advertising campaign and make them better off. We also send a clear message to e-retailers that their leverage of engaging in flexible competition is contingent on the size of their operational costs. In particular, as operational costs decrease, they should be more mindful of engaging in the flexible competition. However, from the standpoint of advertising agents (e.g., Facebook.com ), because firms’ advertising efforts are lower in flexible than committed competition, we would recommend that the advertising agents adopt differential pricing schemes under the two modes of competition. In particular, the agents need to offer discounts to the e-retailers signing flexible advertising contracts so as to step up the advertising competition. In addition, our findings also provide the advertising agents with guidance on how to determine the optimal value for the discounts to be offered.},

Firms compete not only for consumers in the product market but also for human capital in the labor market. In this study, we perform an interfirm labor market competitor analysis using the online profiles of more than 89,000 employees and their career histories that span more than 3,000 public firms. Using these profiles, we characterize firms through the granular skill distribution of their employees. Also, using employee migrations across firms, we derive and analyze a human capital flow (HCF) network. Such information allows us to measure the interfirm human capital overlap in terms of similarity in their employees’ skills and HCF network structure. We show that our proposed human capital overlap metrics have superior predictive power over conventional firm-level measures in predicting future labor market competitors. We further demonstrate how our proposed metrics and the prediction framework can be incorporated into a comprehensive two-dimensional competitor analysis that includes both product and labor overlap between firms. By evaluating interfirm relationships in the product and labor markets simultaneously, this two-dimensional competitor analysis framework can help managers make strategic decisions beyond human resources, such as product development and customer relationship management.},

Despite the importance of understanding the nature of online consumers' concerns for information privacy, this topic has received little attention in the information systems community. To fill the gap in the literature, this article focuses on three distinct, yet closely related, issues. First, drawing on social contract theory, we offer a theoretical framework on the dimensionality of Internet users' information privacy concerns (IUIPC). Second, we attempt to operationalize the multidimensional notion of IUIPC using a second-order construct, and we develop a scale for it. Third, we propose and test a causal model on the relationship between IUIPC and behavioral intention toward releasing personal information at the request of a marketer. We conducted two separate field surveys and collected data from 742 household respondents in one-on-one, face-to-face interviews. The results of this study indicate that the second-order IUIPC factor, which consists of three first-order dimensions—namely, collection, control, and awareness—exhibited desirable psychometric properties in the context of online privacy. In addition, we found that the causal model centering on IUIPC fits the data satisfactorily and explains a large amount of variance in behavioral intention, suggesting that the proposed model will serve as a useful tool for analyzing online consumers' reactions to various privacy threats on the Internet.},

Using Twitter data from the political domain, we show that positive and negative-toned content receive higher engagement, as measured by retweets, than mixed or neutral toned tweets. However, less popular human brands generate higher social media engagement from positive-toned content compared with more popular human brands. Therefore, we recommend that popular human brands (e.g., popular politicians or chief executive officers) keep their content objective rather than emotional. Furthermore, the tone of related brands (i.e., human brands who belong to the same political party) has a strong reinforcement effect; that is, social media engagement is higher when the tone of the focal human brand and related brands are the same and lower when the tones are different. Therefore, we prescribe that human brands actively coordinate their social media content with related brands to generate higher engagement. From human brands’ perspective, our findings recommend a comprehensive social media strategy, which takes into account the tone of content, tone of related brands’ content, and human brands’ popularity.},

   abstract                      = {The wide variety of pricing policies used in practice by data sellers suggests that there are significant challenges in pricing data sets. In this paper, we develop a utility framework that is appropriate for data buyers and the corresponding pricing of the data by the data seller. Buyers interested in purchasing a data set have private valuations in two aspects—their ideal record that they value the most, and the rate at which their valuation for the records in the data set decays as they differ from the buyers’ ideal record. The seller allows individual buyers to filter the data set and select the records that are of interest to them. The multidimensional private information of the buyers coupled with the endogenous selection of records makes the seller’s problem of optimally pricing the data set a challenging one. We formulate a tractable model and successfully exploit its special structure to obtain optimal and near-optimal data-selling mechanisms. Specifically, we provide insights into the conditions under which a commonly used mechanism—namely, a price-quantity schedule—is optimal for the data seller. When the conditions leading to the optimality of a price-quantity schedule do not hold, we show that the optimal price-quantity schedule offers an attractive worst-case guarantee relative to an optimal mechanism. Further, we numerically solve for the optimal mechanism and show that the actual performance of two simple and well-known price-quantity schedules—namely, two-part tariff and two-block tariff—is near optimal. We also quantify the value to the seller from allowing buyers to filter the data set.},

When used wrong, retailers lost revenue unnecessarily and sometimes went out of business. Even now, in 2020, you can find lovers and haters of daily deals, and yet they remain an integral part of the marketing mix for many retailers. One lingering question about these deals remained: How do customers perceive a retailer that offers daily deals before going to the retailer? Do retailers look desperate or confident? Through a series of laboratory experiments, we test whether offering a deal changes consumers’ preconsumption brand evaluations. Our research shows that brand evaluations are contingent on the retailer type (i.e., price segment and age), the success of the current deals offered (i.e., number of page visits and purchases), and the number of competitors that are also using deals. Together, our work demonstrates specific conditions where offering deals may lead to positive or negative consumer perceptions even before arriving at the retailer.},

   abstract                      = {Providers of free-to-play games often gain revenue by monetizing players’ playtime, for example, through in-game advertising and by selling premium modules of the game. One emerging strategy to sell the premium module, known as the virtual selling strategy, is to set the module price based on an amount of virtual currency that players can either spend on playtime to earn or use real currency to buy. In this paper, we examine how the virtual selling strategy leads to different market outcomes than the traditional real selling strategy where players can purchase the premium module using real currency only. We focus on the differences caused by one specific feature—players can pay for the module indirectly using their playtime in the virtual selling strategy. We show that when the provider’s efficiency of monetizing players’ playtime, that is, the time revenue rate, is above a threshold, the virtual selling strategy will benefit the provider and hurt the overall consumer surplus compared with the real selling strategy, even though players in the virtual selling strategy have one additional way, that is, using their playtime, to pay for the module. We identify an undocumented overcompensation effect that causes the profit augmentation and the surplus reduction. The overcompensation effect also results in a U-shaped relationship between the equilibrium module price and the time revenue rate in the virtual selling strategy when the module only provides a small number of new gaming stages. It contradicts the traditional result from the real selling strategy that the provider shall reduce the module price when she becomes more efficient in monetizing players’ playtime.},

   abstract                      = {Disinformation on social media—commonly called “fake news”—has become a major concern around the world, and many fact-checking initiatives have been launched in response. However, if the presentation format of fact-checked results is not persuasive, fact-checking may not be effective. For instance, Facebook tested the idea of flagging dubious articles in 2017 but concluded that it was ineffective and removed the feature. We conducted three experiments with social media users to investigate two different approaches to implementing a fake news flag—one designed to be most effective when processed by automatic cognition (System 1) and the other designed to be most effective when processed by deliberate cognition (System 2). Both interventions were effective, and an intervention that combined both approaches was about twice as effective. The awareness training on the meaning of the flags increased the effectiveness of the System 2 intervention but not the System 1 intervention. Believability influenced the extent to which users would engage with the article (e.g., read, like, comment, and share). Our results suggest that both theoretical routes can be used—separately or together—in the presentation of fact-checking results in order to reduce the influence of fake news on social media users.},

Affordance perception determines how organizational information technology (IT) is used by employees and the benefits they provide to organizations and their members. In this article, we explain how employees who pursue different personal goals and use various learning strategies come to perceive different IT affordances. We identify three distinct pathways: (1) performance-avoidance goals are positively associated with surface processing, which leads to perceptions of common in-role IT affordances; (2) performance-approach goals are positively associated with surface processing and effort regulation and these learning strategies lead to perceptions of common and specialized in-role IT affordances; and (3) mastery goals are associated with deep processing, effort regulation, and peer learning, which are positively associated with perceptions of specialized in-role and extra-role IT affordances. By identifying the different pathways to perceived affordances, the article identifies potential interventions that can help managers steer employees toward certain affordances and away from other, less desirable affordances.},

Trade commissions and even supreme courts recognize the need for economic analysis as the nature of competition changes in the market. There have been many mergers and acquisitions across platform-based businesses. In the ride-sharing sector, Lyft and Didi Chuxing were initially in a partnership to thwart Uber but Uber merged its operation with Didi Chuxing eventually. Amazon and Walmart competed fiercely to buy the Indian online retailer Flipkart, which Walmart eventually won. Traditional antitrust models studying the implications of mergers do not consider the underlying network structure of these intermediary markets. This is the main focus of our model and analysis. We provide a network measurement to evaluate the effect of mergers on welfare. Our analysis shows that because of the underlying networks mergers can sometimes improve welfare.},

The results obtained from a difference-in-differences analysis support our hypotheses on the direct and congruence effects of television program–induced emotions. Findings on the direct effect suggest that television program–induced emotional shocks (e.g., frustration after a fumble or joyness after a touchdown) have a significant effect on the arousal and valence of viewers’ online WOM toward ads subsequently. We additionally find that a match between television program–induced emotional shocks and the emotional content of ads leads to a more significant increase in the arousal and more favorable valence of online WOM responses to ads subsequently. Our findings suggest that advertisers should pay attention to the emotional context of ads in which the ads are placed and the content of ads. It would be more optimal to allocate ads into different programs or different positions in a certain program such that the context of ads and the content of ads are carefully matched or contrasted, especially when ads are likely to stimulate positive feedback from the audience.},

   abstract                      = {Augmented reality (AR)–based applications have been growing in prominence. Pokémon Go, one of the most popular AR game applications, has been engaging in strategic partnership with businesses. The game combines geospatial elements with gamification practices to incentivize user movement in the physical world. In this study, we examine the value of such strategic partnerships between Pokémon Go and associated businesses. Specifically, we use data of the online reviews for a firm to study consumer engagement and consumer perception after the release of the game on its associated businesses. We find that restaurants associated with Pokémon Go do indeed enjoy a higher level of consumer engagement and more positive consumer perception. We also find that characteristics of the business significantly moderate this impact overall. Using a parsimonious analytical model, we also demonstrate the mechanism behind these results. Our study provides insights into consumer economic behavior in the context of AR applications. We further inform the business owners and policymakers regarding the potential value of such strategic business partnerships with such applications.},

Our analysis shows that transactions in the mobile channel are more concentrated on “head” products compared with PC channel sales. However, it does not imply that the presence of the mobile channel concentrates the demand on head products in online markets, given that mobile channel users can purchase products in the PC channel as well. On the basis of the subsequent user-level analysis, we reveal that in the case of preference goods such as books, CDs, toys, and fashion items, mobile commerce channel adoption increased e-market users’ search activities and resulted in more “tail” product sales. For quality goods such as PCs, phones, cameras, and digital appliances, however, adoption intensified the search activities but resulted in more head product sales. Finally, for convenience goods such as home supplies and processed foods, adoption discouraged search activities and decreased the choice of tail products.},

   abstract                      = {Organizational ambidexterity refers to the capability of businesses to balance the pursuit of radical innovation simultaneously with incremental innovation. It echoes the popular notion that to thrive well in a competitive economy, businesses need to balance their exploration of new markets and products with exploitation or balance operational efficiency with flexibility. Digital technologies have become central to enabling organizational ambidexterity. The analysis reveals how the three dimensions of digitization efforts—IT implementation spending, IT training, and actual IT usage—should be combined with specific internal and external factors to develop greater ambidexterity. Two of these complementary factors are either a centralized organizational structure or a strong supplier and partner network—the first a likely channel for cross-organizational knowledge transfer and the second for interfirm knowledge transfers. However, determining which combinations are useful also depends on the size of the business and competitiveness of markets. Large businesses, or those in more competitive sectors, derive a slightly greater advantage from digitization than small firms or those in less competitive sectors. These findings are useful for policy makers tasked with subsidy allocation to industry sectors and managers when allocating investment spending for digitization.},

How can companies unobtrusively identify shopping motives without explicit user input? We demonstrate that eye movement data allow building reliable prediction models for identifying goal-directed and exploratory shopping motives. Our approach is validated in a real supermarket and in an immersive virtual reality supermarket. Several managerial implications of using gaze-based classification of information search behavior are discussed: First, the advent of virtual shopping environments makes using our approach straightforward as eye movement data are readily available in next-generation virtual reality devices. Virtual environments can be adapted to individual needs once shopping motives are identified and can be used to generate more emotionally engaging customer experiences. Second, identifying exploratory behavior offers opportunities for marketers to adapt marketing communication and interaction processes. Personalizing the shopping experience and profiling customers’ needs based on eye movement data promises to further increase conversion rates and customer satisfaction. Third, eye movement-based recommender systems do not need to interrupt consumers and thus do not take away attention from the purchase process. Finally, our paper outlines the technological basis of our approach and discusses the practical relevance of individual predictors.},

Will this identity-disclosure policy in one section also change users’ behaviors in the other section? We answer these questions by using a natural experiment where a large corporate online community chose to disclose users’ identities in one section (the focal section) but not the other (the neighbor section). Our analyses show that in the focal section, disclosing identity increases social presence and inhibits users’ willingness to generate content, resulting in greater effort spent per content but smaller content volume. Moreover, identity disclosure in the focal section has a strong displacement effect: users generate more pieces of content but decrease their effort per content in the neighbor section, where they remain anonymous. The intensity of these effects depends on users’ pursuit of volume- and effort-based image. For the managers of online communities, disclosing users’ identity information inevitably changes their content-generation activities, and the unintended displacement effect cannot be overlooked. Practitioners can adjust these effects by changing reward systems and how users earn image from content generation. Given that many websites rely on users’ voluntary content generation, the effects of relevant policies should be comprehensively evaluated.},

   abstract                      = {There is a surge of interest in social science studies in applying data mining methods to construct variables for regression analysis. For example, text classification was applied to classify whether the review is subjective or objective. The derived review subjectivity was used as an independent variable in the regression to examine its impact on review helpfulness. In the classification phase of these studies, researchers need to subjectively choose a classification performance metric for optimization. No matter which performance metric is chosen, the constructed variable still includes classification error because the variable cannot be classified perfectly. The misclassification of constructed variables will lead to inconsistent estimators of regression coefficients in the following phase. To correct the estimation inconsistency, we summarize and modify existing proofs in econometrics to derive theoretical formulas of consistent estimators in generalized linear models. The main implication of our theoretical result is that the inconsistency can be corrected by theoretical formulas, even when the classification accuracy is poor. Therefore, we propose that a classification algorithm should be tuned to minimize the standard error of the focal coefficient derived based on the corrected formula. As a result, researchers derive a consistent and most precise estimator in generalized linear models.},

The econometric analyses demonstrate a significant spillover effect, where product reviewers, after experiencing the receipt of financial incentives, tend to produce more positive but lower-quality unincentivized reviews subsequently. Theoretically, this paper advances our understanding of the interplay between financial incentives and prosocial behaviors through the lens of self-determination theory. Practically, this study provides insights into the design of online prosocial communities. Managers should not be enticed solely by an immediate increase in contribution quantity because the increased contribution volume might come at the cost of decreased quality in future unincentivized contributions. If platforms decide to provide financial incentives, they should target only altruistic contributors and limit the amount of incentives that an individual can receive. These findings provide important managerial implications for platforms hoping to motivate users’ prosocial contributions.},

In the case of strangers, the effect of learning is stronger for vertically differentiated products than for horizontally differentiated products; whereas in the case of friends, the effect of learning for vertically differentiated products is similar to that for horizontally differentiated products. Moreover, the type of product impacts the magnitude of observational learning. For horizontally differentiated products, the effect of learning from friends is stronger than that from strangers; whereas for vertically differentiated products, the effect of learning from friends is similar to that from strangers. These findings provide motivation for online retailers to generate alternative strategies for increasing product sales through social networks. For example, online retailers offering horizontally differentiated products have strong incentives to cooperate with social media platforms (e.g., Instagram and Pinterest) in encouraging customers to share their purchase information.},

Activity-centric approaches to process modeling capture the mechanistic components of a process (including aspects of workflow, decision, and information), but agent-centric approaches capture specific aspects of the human component. In this paper, we explore an integrative viewpoint in which the transactional aspects of agent-centric concerns—for example, economic incentives for agents to perform—are integrated with decision and informational aspects of a process. To illustrate issues in this approach, we focus on modeling incentive mechanisms in a specific sales process and present results from an extensive simulation experiment. Our results highlight the importance of considering the effects of incentives when decision and informational aspects of a process undergo changes.},

   abstract                      = {Iterative combinatorial auctions are known to resolve bidder preference elicitation problems. However, winner determination is a known key bottleneck that has prevented widespread adoption of such auctions, and adding a time-bound to winner determination further complicates the mechanism. As a result, heuristic-based methods have enjoyed an increase in applicability. We add to the growing body of work in heuristic-based winner determination by proposing an ant colony metaheuristic–based anytime algorithm that produces optimal or near-optimal winner determination results within specified time. Our proposed algorithm resolves the speed versus accuracy problem and displays superior performance compared with 20 past state-of-the-art heuristics and two exact algorithms, for 94 open test auction instances that display a wide variety in bid-bundle composition. Furthermore, we contribute to the literature in two predominant ways: first, we represent the winner determination problem as one of finding the maximum weighted path on a directed cyclic graph; second, we improve upon existing ant colony heuristic–based exploration methods by implementing randomized pheromone updating and randomized graph pruning. Finally, to aid auction designers, we implement the anytime property of the algorithm, which allows auctioneers to stop the algorithm and return a valid solution to the winner determination problem even if it is interrupted before computation ends.},

Real-time feedback applications enable supervisors and employees to give, seek, and receive competency-based feedback using their computers, smartphones, or other devices. In this study, we examine the role of one such real-time feedback application to understand its effects on employee performance appraisals. First, we seek better understanding of how workplace relationships affect employee feedback across managers, colleagues, and direct reports and find that feedback tends to be more critical when given by managers. What is even more important from an industry perspective is the role of preferential treatment and retaliation. Managers can be more transactional, but colleagues are not. We also highlight a series of gender observations: men rate women higher than men, and women rate men and women similar to how men rate men. We conclude by finding that positive real-time feedback has a stronger effect on an employee’s future ratings than negative feedback. Our findings have direct implications for the design and implementation of performance management systems and highlight how companies can use information systems to create an innovative human resource operation that delivers flexibility and agility.},

   abstract                      = {Many firms buy cloud services from cloud vendors, such as Amazon Web Services to serve end users. One of the key factors that affect the quality of cloud services is congestion. Congestion leads to a potential loss of end users, resulting in lower demand for cloud services. Although discount can stimulate demand, its effect under congestion is ambiguous; a higher discount leads to higher demand, but it can further lead to higher congestion, thereby lowering demand. We explore how congestion moderates both cloud vendor pricing and the buyer’s fulfillment decisions. We seek to answer how the congestion sensitivity of the end users and the cost of technology impact buyer profitability and the cloud vendor’s choice of discount. We also examine how the cost of technology determines the buyer’s willingness to pass on savings to end users. Our results show that the buyer is not necessarily worse off even when the end users are more intolerant to congestion. In fact, when end users are more congestion sensitive, the demand for cloud services can sometimes increase, and the discount offered by the vendor can decrease. We also observe that a lower cost of technology can sometimes hurt the buyer, and the buyer can pass on lower benefits to end users.},

   abstract                      = {Digital transformations often require firms to align and synchronize their information technology (IT) and business initiatives. In this context, one important question that managers face is where they should focus most when aligning IT and business for leveraging IT investment for firm performance. Authors argue that firms that focus on IT–business alignment at the later stages (i.e., IT delivery and IT change) are better able to translate their IT investment into revenue than firms that focus on IT–business alignment at the early stage (i.e., IT investment planning) of the IT lifecycle. They use archival data from more than 120 firms in India and find that the positive relationship between IT investment and firm revenue is stronger for firms that focus on IT delivery–business alignment or IT change–business alignment than for firms that focus on IT investment planning–business alignment. In addition, they find that at higher levels of IT investment, firms that focus on IT change–business alignment or IT delivery–business alignment have higher revenue than firms that focus on IT investment planning–business alignment, whereas at low levels of IT investment, firms that focus on IT investment planning–business alignment outperform firms that focus on IT delivery–business alignment or IT change–business alignment. Taken together, these findings can help managers to improve the success of their digital transformation efforts by tailoring their alignment efforts across planning, delivery, and change stages.},

This is an important managerial question as creating effective chatbot experiences through messaging platforms has proven difficult for organizations. Often, chatbot developers apply characteristics such as giving a chatbot a human name, adding humor, and so on, without knowing how these features influence end user behavior. Implementing a field experiment in collaboration with a dual channel clothing retailer based in the United States, we automate a used clothing buy-back process, such that individuals engage with the retailer's autonomous chatbot to describe the used clothes they wish to sell, obtain a cash offer, and (if they accept) print a shipping label to finalize the transaction. We provide evidence that, in this retail setting, anthropomorphism is beneficial for transaction outcomes, but that it also leads to significant increases in consumers’ sensitivity to the offer amount. We argue that the latter effect occurs because, as a chatbot becomes more human-like, consumers shift to a fairness evaluation or negotiating mindset.},

These efforts rely on consumers to scan the products they purchase using these apps, which we refer to as consumer scanning technology (CST). CST can be an alternative to the conventional interorganizational information technology (IOIT) that relies on collaboration between supply chain firms. This paper develops a theoretical model to examine the value of CST to learn supply chain (demand) information and the impact of CST on IOIT. Using an extensive simulation analysis based on real-world data from a manufacturer that has implemented a CST program, we show that the value of CST to a manufacturer can be substantial and provide insights into how market conditions affect the value.},

This paper analyzes the equilibrium implications of platform recommendation as an intervention that shifts (a portion of) consumer search effort and demand from the rest of the market to the recommended products. Our analysis provides the theoretical basis for determining which types of products the platform should recommend to optimize total producer profits or consumer surplus. We find that the quality and taste-dispersion dimensions can interact to affect the overall effectiveness of product recommendation strategies, and, in general, recommendation strategies based on observed price or sales signals cannot guarantee the optimal outcome.},

   abstract                      = {This research investigates how a shift from traditional loyalty cards to mobile-driven loyalty apps affects consumers’ reward redemption patterns, purchase behaviors, and store-level competition. The findings indicate that loyalty app adoption is associated with increased expenditure and purchase frequency as well as more active point redemption. In a multivendor loyalty program (MVLP) context, the use of loyalty apps is associated with spillover effects in which case customers visit more stores that they had not previously considered and exhibit diminished allegiance to their focal shop after they adopt a loyalty app. Finally, the adoption of loyalty apps is related to deal-prone behaviors because informed consumers tend to selectively purchase highly discounted products. Our findings provide several valuable implications for managers and platform owners who are considering launching mobile loyalty programs (LPs) and participating in an MVLP market. Although the merits of loyalty app adoption are apparent, we caution against potential downsides at individual store levels. Many customers are likely to succumb to deals, selectively purchasing highly discounted products with low margins through loyalty apps. The thrust of LPs should be directed toward fostering a strong connection with a brand, going beyond the promise of deals and promotions.},

   abstract                      = {Global e-commerce sales have experienced unprecedented growth for the past years and have reached over $2 trillion annually. One interesting phenomenon along with this remarkable growth is that giant online retailers, such as Amazon.com in the United States and JD.com in China, open their platforms and allow third-party sellers to offer products there, thus inviting competition. We explore why an online retailer would open its platform and why a third-party seller would join the platform. We highlight the role of a spillover effect that, when the third-party seller joins the retailer’s platform, more consumers become aware of the third-party seller’s existence and its products which are not even listed on the retailer’s platform. We characterize how the third-party seller’s optimal selling strategies should vary with and how the retailer’s openness decision should be determined by the extent of the spillover effect and the retailer’s initial awareness advantage. Compared with the case without a spillover effect, the spillover effect makes the retailer less likely to open its platform, but it makes the third-party seller more likely to sell identical products on an open retailer platform; the spillover effect always (weakly) benefits the third-party seller, but it does not necessarily hurt the retailer.},

   abstract                      = {Overcrowding in emergency rooms (ERs) is a common yet nagging problem. It not only is costly for hospitals but also compromises care quality and patient experience. Our paper provides solid evidence that telemedicine can significantly improve ER care delivery, especially in the presence of demand and supply fluctuations. We believe such findings are critical for ERs, due to the special setting of unscheduled arrivals leading to high unpredictability of patient traffic. Additional evidence suggests that the efficiency gained from telemedicine does not come at the expense of lower care quality or higher medical expenditure, which points to telemedicine as a feasible solution to the ER overcrowding problem. For healthcare practitioners, our paper highlights the general applicability of telemedicine through the “hub and spoke” architecture. Besides increasing patients’ access to more immediate care from specialists who were not available otherwise, telemedicine enables flexible resource allocation for any hospitals, regardless of where hospitals are located. Our research also provides ground for policymakers to incentivize hospitals to adopt telemedicine in ER, which we believe is critical given the relatively low adoption rate, the lack of direct evidence on its effectiveness, and the current inflexibility of reimbursement policies regarding the application of ER telemedicine.},

   abstract                      = {Contemporary social media fueled social protest is self-organized, rapidly dynamic, and decentralized, constitutes vast populations, and is shaped by multiple and concurrent channels of information flows. Such protest activity is captured in the concept of social protest cycles, which are short periods of intense and contentious protest activity characterized by temporal dynamics, a large repertoire of protest action, confrontation and potential violence, and possible institutional action. Social protest cycles are the microfoundations of long-term social movements. They contain the seeds of potential societal transformation because their intense collective action can be constructively harnessed toward change. This paper examines the role of social media in social protest cycles. Drawing from the theoretical concept of sociomaterial assemblages, we conceptualize the social media enabled social protest cycle as an assemblage having social (e.g., people, elected leaders, police, judges) and technical (e.g., social media applications, online petition applications) components. We analyze how the social protest cycle transforms through performative intra-actions. The empirical context for the study is a social media enabled social protest cycle that emerged after a fatal rape incident in New Delhi, India. Data pertaining to the social protest cycle over the period December 17–25, 2012, were collected from social media activity on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, online blogs, and newspaper websites. Through mixed methods analysis we identify three intra-actions, consolidation, expansion, and intensification, and theorize how they transform the social protest cycle over time. The paper contributes to the information systems literature that studies social media–enabled social protest action. As theoretical contributions, it develops (1) the notion of intra-actions as organizing mechanisms and (2) a relational ontology for social media–enabled social protest action. Through these contributions, we suggest that the power of social media lies in its socially produced and emergent relationships with other entities in the social protest cycle.},

   abstract                      = {This paper investigates how citizens’ uncertainty in e-government services can be managed. First, we draw from uncertainty reduction theory, and propose that transparency and trust are two key means of reducing citizens’ uncertainty in e-government services. Second, we identify two key sets of relevant drivers of e-government service use: (1) information quality characteristics, i.e., accuracy and completeness; and (2) channel characteristics, i.e., convenience and personalization. We propose that the means of uncertainty reduction, information quality characteristics, and channel characteristics are interrelated factors that jointly influence citizens’ intentions to use e-government. We tested our model with 4,430 Hong Kong citizens’ reactions to two e-government services: government websites and online appointment booking. Our results show that the information quality and channel characteristics predict citizens’ intentions to use e-government. Furthermore, transparency and trust mediate as well as moderate the effects of information quality and channel characteristics on intentions. A follow-up survey found that citizens’ intentions predict use and ultimately, citizens’ satisfaction.},

   abstract                      = {This study examines the dynamic relationships between firm-generated content (FGC), user-generated content (UGC), traditional media, and offline light vehicle sales. Data were collected from the official Facebook and Twitter pages of 30 U.S. car brands from 2009 to 2015. Our results suggest that Facebook and Twitter are heterogeneous in terms of their effect on offline vehicle sales; FGC is more effective than UGC for influencing offline light vehicle sales; viral impressions from Facebook and Twitter are essential, although effects vary for the various social media platforms, FGC, and UGC; and a firm’s marketing efforts and UGC both have a long-term effect on sales, with the long-term effect of a firm’s marketing efforts outlasting that of UGC. We also documented the within-Twitter synergistic effect between FGC and UGC for offline car sales and cross-channel substitution relationships between FGC and both Facebook and traditional media and Twitter and traditional media. Our study implies that managers who attempt to maximize multichannel marketing for offline sales of durable goods should consider (1) the nature of each platform, (2) the number of potential audiences each platform can reach, and (3) the user basis of each platform.},

Yet little is known about how physicians’ online and offline activities affect each other and, consequently, the healthcare system. We collected data from both online and offline channels to study physicians’ online-offline behavior dynamics. We find that physicians’ online activities can lead to a higher service quantity in offline channels, whereas offline activities may reduce physicians’ online services because of resource constraints. We also find that the more offline patients that physicians serve, the more articles the physicians will likely share in online healthcare platforms. These findings are of great importance to practitioners and policy makers. Our work provides evidence that online healthcare platforms supplement offline services and thus lessen the concern that physicians’ participation in online healthcare platforms will negatively influence offline healthcare services. Our findings also indicate the need for the improvement of online-offline coordination and better system design.},

   abstract                      = {Social media harassment, a cyberbullying behavior, poses a serious threat to users and platform owners of social media. In this paper, we contextualize the bystander intervention framework and reporting literature to social media in order to understand why bystanders report social media harassment. Our contextualized intervention framework focuses on three sociotechnical aspects—the online social environment, characteristics of the technology platform, and their interplay—that explain bystander reporting on social media platforms. We tested the model using data gathered from active Facebook users. Our findings direct practitioners’ attention to the role of the platform in encouraging bystanders to help stop social media harassment. For policy makers, our findings direct attention to supporting programs that encourage social media users to feel responsible for reporting harassment and making transparent the outcomes of reporting social media harassment using anonymous reporting tools. For platform owners, our findings direct attention to investing in tools that enable anonymous reporting, to fostering a climate that encourages reporting, and to ensuring that all users understand that reporting social media harassment results in swift, effective responses from platform owners. Taken together, we believe our research offer insight into how to build safer and secure social media platforms.},

In this paper, we present a model to study the market incentives of P2P lending platforms' optimal information-reporting strategies when the following exist: (i) uncertainty on the return of loans and (ii) competition from entrants. We focus on the information bias of platforms driven by demand-side actors—investors’ optimism/pessimism about risk—while we keep the platforms being rational. We characterize platforms' equilibrium reporting strategies under different market conditions. Surprisingly, we find that when uncertainty is significant, and the threat of entry is strong but not detrimental, the platform has incentives to bias information toward investors' biased beliefs. This result demonstrates a case where competition and uncertainty may jointly lead to information bias. However, a properly designed uncertainty-resolution mechanism could reduce the incentive. Our findings contribute to the literature on the P2P lending market by analyzing platform decisions and offer policy implications for regulating P2P lending market.},

We first develop a data science approach to detect customer misbehavior on social media and devise intervention strategies to deter it. Our design science approach achieves superior performance, improving detection by 7%–9% compared with traditional methods. We then implement two types of intervention policies based on injunctive (i.e., a punishment policy) and descriptive norms (i.e., a common identity policy) to restrain customer misbehavior. The results of field experiments indicate that punishment considerably reduces customer misbehavior in the short term, but this effect decays over time, whereas common identity has a smaller but more persistent effect on misbehavior reduction. In addition, punishing dysfunctional customers decreases their purchase frequency, whereas imposing a common identity increases it. Our results also show that combining the two policies effectively alleviates the detrimental effect of punishment, especially in the long run.},

   abstract                      = {Nonlinear usage-based pricing is applied extensively in software markets. Customers of software products usually cannot vary their required usage volume, a property we label local demand inelasticity. For instance, a client firm that needs a sales force automation software either buys one user license for every salesperson or does not buy at all. It is unlikely to buy licenses for some but not all salespersons. This demand feature violates a critical assumption of the standard nonlinear pricing literature that consumers are flexible with their usage volume, and their valuation changes smoothly with usage volume. Consequently, standard nonlinear pricing solutions are inapplicable to many software products. This paper studies the optimal nonlinear usage-based pricing of software when customers' demand is locally inelastic. This unique demand feature necessitates a new approach to solve the nonlinear pricing problem. We show that under a weak ordering condition of customer types, this complex pricing problem can be decomposed into a set of much simpler subproblems with known solutions. Our pricing solution is easily implementable and applicable to a broad range of demand systems, including those described by the families of exponential and normal distributions. Moreover, local demand inelasticity has a critical impact on key efficiency results.},

We test our model using data from an online survey of 1,210 customers of mobile data services. The results show that service leadership and customization-personalization control have significant direct impacts on ICT service providers' brand equity. Moreover, when either the level of technology leadership or the level of customization-personalization control is high, the impact of service leadership on brand equity is enhanced. In turn, brand equity has significant impacts on consumers' affective loyalty and conative loyalty, but not on cognitive loyalty. Our study contributes to the literature on service management and service science, and in particular to the management of ICT service innovation in a consumer technology market.},

   abstract                      = {Scarcity-based marketing strategy has been prevalently implemented in reward-based crowdfunding in the form of reward limits, whereby campaign creators restrict the number of backers for each reward tier. This study uncovers the effect of reward limits on eventual and concurrent funding performance. Specifically, we performed campaign-level and campaign day–level analyses on a unique data set from a dominant crowdfunding platform. At the campaign level, we determined that setting reward limits at the beginning of a campaign is beneficial, with the number of limited reward tiers exerting an inverted-U-shaped relationship with campaign performance. Further exploration of different forms of reward limits suggests that the scarcity effects largely originate from limited edition and price discount rewards. At the campaign day level, we determined that incorporating new limited edition rewards is helpful for attracting new contributions, whereas depleted price discount rewards will demotivate subsequent contributions. In addition, the goal-directed mechanism in crowdfunding plays an influential role in shaping scarcity effects. Our findings highlight the importance of considering backer-as-consumer needs in crowdfunding campaign design and the dynamics of campaign attribute changes in the fundraising process. Our findings also provide important practical implications for platform operators, campaign creators, and marketers.},

Our study helps managers decide on the effort they should use to manage online reputation. We consider an online reputation race in which it is important not just to manage the absolute reputation, but also the relative rating. That is, to stay ahead, a firm should try to have ratings that are better than those of its competitors. Our findings are particularly significant for platform owners (such as Expedia or Yelp) to strategically grow their base of participating firms: growing the middle of the market (firms with average ratings) is the best option considering the goals of the platform and the other stakeholders, namely incumbents and consumers. For firms, we find that they should increase their effort when the mean market rating increases. Another key insight for firms is that, sometimes, adversity can come disguised as an opportunity. When an adverse event strikes the industry (such as a reduction in sales margin or an increase in the cost of effort), a firm’s profit can increase if it can manage this event better than its competitors.},

We find significant differences between new and experienced drivers in both learning behavior and driving decisions. Drivers benefit significantly from their ability to learn from not only information directly observable in the local market but also aggregate information on demand flows across markets. Interestingly, our policy simulations indicate that information that is noisy at the individual level becomes valuable when aggregated across relevant spatial and temporal dimensions. Moreover, we find that the value of information does not increase monotonically with the scale and frequency of information sharing. Our results also provide important evidence that efficient information sharing can lead to a welfare increase because of potential market expansion. Efficient information sharing can bring additional income-generating opportunities that could be unfulfilled. Overall, this study not only explains driver decision-making behavior but also provides taxi companies with an implementable information-sharing strategy to improve overall market efficiency.},

   abstract                      = {For decades, brand managers have monitored brand health with the use of consumer surveys, which have been refined to address issues related to sampling bias, response bias, leading questions, etc. However, with the advance of Web 2.0 and the internet, consumers have turned to social media to express their opinions on a variety of topics and, subsequently, have generated an extremely large amount of interaction data with brands. Analyzing these publicly available data to measure brand health has attracted great research attention. In this study, we focus on developing a method to measure brand favorability while accounting for the measure biases exhibited by social media posters. Specifically, we propose a probabilistic graphical model–based collective inference framework and implement a block-based Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling technique to obtain an adjusted brand favorability measure that is correlated with traditional survey-based measures used by brands. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we evaluate it using more than 3,300 brands and about 205 million unique users that interact with those brands collected through Facebook. Our model performs very well, providing brand managers with a new method to more accurately measure consumer opinions toward the brand using social media data.},

   abstract                      = {Recently companies are increasingly adopting intelligent technologies, such as autonomous tools and artificial intelligence, to assist complex knowledge works that are traditionally carried out by human experts. These tools can independently learn and execute novel actions. The input–output relationships of these tools, however, are unknowable to human experts. This calls for analysis of how humans may work differently while interacting with such tools. To this end, we conduct a comparative case study at one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers. We investigate how chip designers interact with two families of design technologies: one following a traditional designer-centric approach in which the designer knows what outputs particular inputs to the tools will generate, and another relying on autonomous tools that continually surprise the user. Our inquiry reveals that, when using autonomous tools, designers can hardly understand the design generated by the tools and become more like laboratory experimentalists in that their primary job is experimenting with different inputs and assessing the quality of the finished design. Their interactions with the tools are marked by ambiguity, and the design is moved forward along multiple design trajectories in accordance with a multifarious temporality.},

   abstract                      = {Digital technologies have led to the emergence of many platforms in our economy today. In certain platform networks, buyers in one market purchase services from providers in many other markets, whereas in others, buyers primarily purchase services from providers within the same market. Accordingly, network interconnectivity—which measures the degree to which consumers in one market purchase services from service providers in a different market—varies across different industries. We examine how network interconnectivity affects interactions between an incumbent platform serving multiple markets and an entrant platform seeking to enter one of these markets. Our model yields several interesting results. First, even if the entrant can advertise at no cost, it still may not want to make every user in a local market aware of its service, as doing so may trigger a competitive response from the incumbent. Second, having more mobile buyers, which increases interconnectivity between markets, can reduce the incumbent’s incentive to fight and, thus, increase the entrant’s incentive to expand. Third, stronger interconnectivity between markets may or may not make the incumbent more defensible: when advertising is not costly and mobile buyers consume in both their local markets and the markets they visit, a large number of mobile buyers will increase the entrant’s profitability, thereby making it difficult for the incumbent to deter entry. However, when advertising is costly or mobile buyers only consume in the markets they travel to, a large number of mobile buyers will help the incumbent deter entry. When advertising cost is at an intermediate level, the entrant prefers a market with moderate interconnectivity between markets. Fourth, we find that even if advanced targeting technologies can enable the entrant to also advertise to mobile buyers, the entrant may choose not to do so in order to avoid triggering the incumbent’s competitive response. Finally, we find that the presence of network effects is likely to decrease the entrant’s profit. Our results offer managerial implications for platform firms and help understand their performance heterogeneity.},

Although the community governance and open collaboration model of Wikipedia confers many benefits, its decentralized nature can leave questions of information poverty and skewness to the mercy of the system's natural dynamics. In this paper, we leverage a large-scale natural experiment to gain a causal understanding of how exogenous content contributions to Wikipedia articles affect the attention that they attract and how that attention spills over to other articles in the information network. We find a positive feedback loop: content contribution leads to significant and long-lasting increases of attention and future contribution. Unfortunately, this also suggests that impoverished regions of information networks are likely to remain so in the absence of intervention. However, our analysis reveals a potential solution. Articles in impoverished regions of information networks are particularly positioned to benefit from the phenomenon of attention spillovers. Using a simulation that is calibrated with real-world link traffic of the Wikipedia network, we show that an attention contagion policy, which focuses editorial effort coherently on impoverished regions, can lead to as much as a twofold gain in attention relative to unguided contributions.},

   abstract                      = {In light of the critical role of price information in consumers’ decision making, this study investigates the effect of price rank on consumers’ responses to product list advertising (PLA). The research documents that the price rank is more influential than actual price for PLA. In addition, the research highlights a tradeoff in price-rank decisions: A price rank that drives more clicks does not necessarily lead to more conversions; to drive traffic, managers should strive for an extreme (i.e., either high or low) to elicit more clicks, then follow up with online engagement tools (e.g., cross-selling and product recommendations). To maximize direct revenue, managers instead should strive for moderate ranks to satisfy consumers’ desire for a compromise between price and quality. However, consumers without uncertainty tend to rely less on price rank, so the effects diminish among specific keywords and increase among popular keywords. In order to achieve the desired price ranks, firms participating in PLA might monitor and adjust their advertising offers. There are commonly two specific avenues: Change the product price if the required change is within a certain range or change the advertised product if the required price change is beyond a certain range.},

In both cases, we offered access to subscription video on demand (SVoD) to a random set of households for several weeks and used another random set of households as control group. In both cases, we find that the households induced to binge-watch TV shows are less likely to pay for SVoD after the free trials. Our results suggest that induced binge-watchers deplete the content of interest to them very quickly, which reduces their short-term willingness to pay for SVoD. We also show that carefully crafted recommendation reminders aimed at widening the preferences of consumers for content offset the negative effect of binge-watching and lessen the concerns of binge-watchers with lack of content refresh, and thus these reminders may help content providers manage supply costs, which may otherwise become prohibitive with frequent updates to SVoD catalogs.},

   abstract                      = {The internet of things (IoT) is rapidly becoming one of the most popular emerging technologies in business and society. One of the major verticals that has recently begun to effectively use IoT technologies is the retail industry. Given the unprecedented opportunities IoT generates for brands and retailers, it is important to glean timely insights regarding the business value of IoT and understand whether the introduction of an IoT technology as an alternative purchase channel for consumers affects the sales of physical products. Using empirical data from a multinational online retailer who adopted an IoT technology that largely automates the consumers’ purchases and employing a quasi-experimental framework, we study the effect of the introduction of IoT as an alternative sales channel on product sales. Our analyses reveal a statistically and economically significant increase in sales and demonstrate the business value of the IoT channel for retailers and brands. In addition, we conduct other analyses of IoT to delve into the effect of heterogeneity and empirically validate the underlying mechanisms by examining the impact of IoT for products in different price ranges, levels of substitutability, and product categories. For instance, our analyses reveal that less expensive and more differentiated products, as well as experience and utilitarian goods, can accrue higher benefits leveraging more effectively novel IoT technologies. This is the first paper to study the impact of an IoT technology on product sales, drawing important implications for devices and technologies largely automating the purchase process.},

   abstract                      = {This study investigates the creative idea generation process in an open innovation platform. The idea generation process is simultaneously influenced by multiple activities: knowledge acquisition from participants’ interactions with each other’s ideas, deliberate practice through persistent participation, and learning through failures. Due to the dynamic interplay across these activities, it is challenging to identify each activity’s influence on creative ideation outcomes using reduced-form regression analysis. To overcome these challenges, we employ a comprehensive empirical framework, the mutually exciting spatiotemporal point process model with unobserved heterogeneity, which endogenizes the occurrences of these activities in continuous time and allows for user-dependent effects. By utilizing the activity stream data of 13,028 participants from 2010 to 2016 in an open innovation platform, we uncovered synergistic effects of these activities on creative outcomes. We find that knowledge acquired through interaction with others (i.e., stimulus ideas) plays a vital role in the creative ideation process, but their effect is more nuanced than what we have known so far. In contrast to the prior belief that distant analogies, stimulus ideas outside of a problem domain, spur creativity, we find that distant analogies lead to failures. Yet, we further find that such failures are indispensable to the creative ideation process because failures motivate idea generators (1) to acquire more knowledge by increasing their future interactions with other participants’ ideas (learning from others), and (2) to persist in generating ideas that lead to improvements in their ability to apply the acquired knowledge and to identify innovation tasks that are relevant to their stock of acquired knowledge (learning by doing). Our results indicate that failures are a stronger driver of the learning activities than successes. Based on our findings, we offer insights on how to cultivate creativity in an open innovation setting.},

To investigate whether privacy uncertainty continues to be a factor after a consumer has already started using an app, we conducted a survey of users of wellness and personal finance apps. The results indicate that privacy uncertainty is a lingering concern because it continues to influence a user’s intention to continue using an app and the perceived risk associated with that continued use.},

   abstract                      = {In the past decade, the proliferation of online marketplace lending has been disrupting the consumer credit market, especially for personal loans for debt consolidation. These lenders, for example, Lending Club, transcend the geographic boundaries within which local banks operate and offer homogeneous access and terms to borrowers. However, the ultimate benefits borrowers derive from marketplace lending can differ significantly because local alternatives may replace marketplace loans when available and favorable. Correspondingly, if local bank competition drives the substitution of an existing marketplace loan with a traditional bank loan, the promise of equal benefits to all borrowers from marketplace lending is unlikely to fully materialize. This competitive dynamic has implications for policy making, particularly in judging the ramifications of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Our results indicate that a borrower who resides in a more competitive market is more likely to pay off a P2P loan early by making a large, one-time payment compared with a borrower from a less competitive market, indicating a substitution with a local bank loan. Thus, borrowers from different markets do not benefit equally from online marketplace lending, disrupting the consumer credit market. In particular, consumers in smaller markets continue to be disadvantaged because of the absence of competitive intensity. This is a consequence of traditional banks competing within their local markets and incentivized to attract marketplace borrowers to traditional loans primarily by their local market conditions. Therefore, unless geographic frictions in traditional lending markets are removed, digital disruptions cannot equalize the benefits to consumers.},

This is great for consumers, but it has makes online review platforms a target for fraud. Review platforms have responded by developing tools and algorithms to identify potentially fraudulent reviews. But the question remains: What should platforms do with fraudulent reviews after detecting them? Our research answers this question using randomized experiments and large-scale data analysis from Yelp’s review platform. Our results show that after detecting fraudulent reviews, platforms should keep them on their platforms, but should display them with a flag that identifies them as potentially fraudulent. Doing so will increase consumers' trust in the platform by demonstrating that the platform takes fraud serious and will also penalize dishonest businesses. Together, these results provide strong managerial and policy guidance to developing truthful, transparent, and accountable online ecosystems. Our research topic is particularly timely given the presence of misinformation on technology platforms, the incentives of actors to exploit anonymity to manipulate consumer beliefs, and the influence these actions can have on consumer trust.},

   abstract                      = {Job erosion is a major concern globally, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment and low wages remain pressing societal challenges in the wake of increased automation, more so for traditionally disadvantaged groups in the labor market, such as women, minorities, and the elderly. However, workers who possess relevant information technology (IT) skills may have an edge in an increasingly digital economy. In this study, we examine the role of IT skills in labor market outcomes for workers, using a household IT use survey from an emerging economy that captures detailed, individual-level data on IT skills, which are also integrated with data on workers’ wages, occupations, and industries between 2007 and 2015. The results indicate that basic IT skills increase individuals’ employment probability, which is driven by both higher labor force participation and a higher probability of transitioning from unemployment to employment, after accounting for the decision to participate in the workforce. Advanced IT skills do not provide a significant incremental effect on employment probability on top of basic IT skills. However, having advanced IT skills helps workers to earn higher wages while incrementally increasing the probability that they are employed in higher-paid jobs. Interestingly, the effect of basic IT skills on employment is significantly larger for the female and older workforce that typically has a higher preference for flexible work options. These results emphasize the importance of providing necessary IT access and offering basic IT training to traditionally disadvantaged groups to close the IT skills gap and the digital divide. We offer implications for the future of work, education, and public policy for designing IT training policies for workers, students, and organizations to stimulate employment with higher wages, particularly in developing economies and for traditionally disadvantaged segments of the workforce, such as women and the elderly, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic.},

   abstract                      = {In the digital era, it is increasingly important to understand how privacy decisions are made because information is frequently perceived as a commodity that is mismanaged. The preponderance of privacy literature focuses on individual-level information privacy concern and personal self-disclosure decisions. We propose that a more versatile multilevel description is required to enable exploration of complex privacy decisions that involve co-owned (i.e., group) information in increasingly sophisticated digital environments. We define the concepts of group and individual information privacy, “we-privacy” and “I-privacy” respectively, as the ability of an individual or group to construct, regulate, and apply the rules for managing their information and interaction with others. We develop the theory of multilevel information privacy (TMIP), which uses the theory of communication privacy management and the developmental theory of privacy as foundations for a social rule-based (i.e., normative) process of making privacy decisions that evolve over time with experience. The TMIP contributes to the privacy literature by drawing from prominent social psychology theories of group behavior (i.e., social identity and self-categorization theories) to explain how privacy decisions can be made by individuals or groups (i.e., social units) or social units acting as members of a particular group. We contend that technology complicates the privacy decision-making process by adding unique environmental characteristics that can influence the social identity assumed for a particular privacy decision, the estimation of the cost-benefit components of the privacy calculus, and the application and evolution of the norms that define the rules for information and interaction management. We discuss the implications of the TMIP for information systems research and provide a research agenda.},

   abstract                      = {In many markets of the digital economy, some products are more prone to online piracy than some of their substitutes. These situations of asymmetric online piracy distort the competition between products. Using the French antipiracy law known as HADOPI (Haute Autorité pour la diffusion des œuvres et la protection des droits d'auteur sur internet) as a natural experiment, we study the asymmetric effects of online piracy on cinema admissions. Applying four estimation strategies at different levels of observation (town, movie, country, and consumer), we find that introduction of the law is associated with a 9% increase in the market share of American movies but that this increase occurs at the expense of other movies. These findings primarily originate from a high initial level of asymmetric piracy between American and other movies. This asymmetry was attenuated by the antipiracy law, resulting in a fiercer competition between movies and, as a side effect, in a decrease in the legal consumption of less-pirated products. These results have important implications for firms whose profits may be affected by legislation fighting piracy as well as for governments for the design of their policy.},

   abstract                      = {Matching with preferences has great potential to coordinate the efficient allocation of scarce resources in organizations when monetary transfers are not available. It is well known that it is impossible to combine all three properties of truthfulness, efficiency, and fairness (i.e., envy freeness) in matching with preferences. Established mechanisms are either efficient or envy free, and the efficiency loss in envy-free mechanisms is substantial. We focus on a widespread representative of a matching problem: course assignment where students have preferences for courses and organizers have priorities over students. An important feature in course assignment is that a course has a maximum capacity and a minimum required quota. This is also a requirement in many other matching applications, such as school choice, hospital-residents matching, or the assignment of workers to jobs. We introduce RESPCT, a mechanism that respects minimum quotas and is truthful, efficient, and has low levels of envy. The reduction in envy is significant and is due to two remarkably effective heuristics. We provide analytical and experimental results based on field data from a large-scale course assignment application. These results have led to a policy change and the proposed assignment system is now being used to match hundreds of students every semester.},

   abstract                      = {A key approach in many organizations to address the myriad of information security threats is encouraging employees to better understand and comply with information security policies (ISPs). Despite a significant body of academic research in this area, a commonly held but questionable assumption in these studies is that noncompliance simply represents the opposite of compliance. Hence, explaining compliance is only half of the story, and there is a pressing need to understand the causes of noncompliance, as well. If organizational leaders understood what leads a normally compliant employee to become noncompliant, future security breaches might be avoided or minimized. In this study, we found that compliant and noncompliant behaviors can be better explained by uncovering actions that focus not only on efficacious coping behaviors, but also those that focus on frustrated users who must sometimes cope with emotions, too. Employees working from a basis of emotion-focused coping are unable to address the threat and, feeling overwhelmed, focus only on controlling their emotions, merely making themselves feel better. Based on our findings, organizations can enhance their security by understanding the “tipping point” where employees’ focus likely changes from problem-solving to emotion appeasement, and instead push them into a more constructive direction.Yan Chen is an associate professor at Florida International University.

We used product rating data from Amazon.com to illustrate the relative importance of fit in driving product utility and the importance of search for determining fit for each product category at Amazon. Our results also show that, whereas ratings based on verified purchasers are informative of objective product values, the current Amazon review system appears to have limited ability to resolve fit uncertainty. Industry practitioners could utilize our approaches to quantitatively measure product positioning to support marketing strategy for retailers and manufacturers, covering an expanded group of products.},

Contemporary treatment for breast cancer is complex and involves highly specialized medical professionals collaborating in a series of information-intensive processes. This poses significant challenges to optimization of treatment plans for individual patients. We propose a novel framework that enables personalization and customization of treatment plans for early stage breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Using a series of simulation experiments benchmarked with real-world clinical data, we demonstrate that the treatment plans generated from our proposed framework consistently outperform those from the existing practices in balancing the risk of local tumor recurrence and radiation-induced adverse effects. Our research sheds new light on how to combine domain knowledge and patient data in developing effective decision-support tools for clinical use. Although our research is specifically geared toward radiotherapy planning for breast cancer, the design principles of our framework can be applied to the personalization of treatment plans for patients with other chronic diseases that typically involve complications and comorbidities.},

In this study, we develop a comprehensive relational topic modeling approach to analyze bilateral reviews for better online transaction prediction. The prediction results will enable the platform to increase the chance that the buyer and seller reach a transaction by presenting buyers with offerings that are more likely to lead to a transaction. Within the framework of the relational topic model, we embed a topic structure with both shared and corpus-specific topics to better handle text corpora generated from different sources. Our model facilitates the extraction of the appropriate topic structure from different document collections that helps enhance the transaction prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world data sets collected from sharing economy platforms demonstrate that our new model significantly outperforms other alternatives. The robust results obtained from multiple sets of comparisons demonstrate the value of bilateral reviews if they are processed properly. Our approach can be applied to many platforms where bilateral reviews are available.},

Nevertheless, CIO structural power should not be overlooked because it could amplify (i.e., positively moderate) the impact of CIO issue selling to digital innovation outcomes. In addition, we identify four enabling forces of CIO issue selling effectiveness: (1) CIO strategic decision-making authority, (2) CIO/TMT partnership, (3) CIO information technologies (IT)–related strategic knowledge, and (4) CIO political savvy. Matched-pair survey data collected from senior business and IT executives of 179 organizations largely support the research hypotheses.},

Intermediaries (e.g., Google) facilitate this match between advertisers and publishers by managing data and providing optimization tools and algorithms for serving ads.

The findings provide a rationale for firms to invest heavily in their social media while countering those who question the value of social media. Using a sample of 63 South Korean firms across industries over a three-year period, we find that a firm’s social media actions yield significant financial returns, and the magnitude of these financial returns depends on the types of communication actions: that is, a firm’s (broadcasted) posts versus its responses to customer messages. Our conceptual framework and empirical methodology can help firms more accurately gauge the ROI of their social media investments and tailor their efforts accordingly. Specifically, our results suggest that promptly responding to customer complaints is a key to increasing customer satisfaction and firm performance. Taken together, our study provides guidance for firms on how to optimize their social media strategies to extract greater value from social media.},

The authors use the SEC crackdown of stock promotion schemes in April 2017 to examine investor attention and the stock price reaction to fake news articles. Using data from Seeking Alpha, the authors find that fake news stories generate significantly more attention than a control sample of legitimate articles. The authors find no evidence that article commenters can detect fake news, and they find that Seeking Alpha editors have only modest ability to detect fake news. However, the authors implement several well-known machine learning algorithms based on linguistic characteristics and show that machine learning algorithms can successfully identify fake news. In addition, the stock market appears to price fake news correctly. While abnormal trading volume increases around the release of fake news, the increase is less than that observed for legitimate news. The stock price reaction to fake news is discounted when compared with legitimate news articles.},
