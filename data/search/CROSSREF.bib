   abstract                      = {Phishing is a significant security concern for organizations, threatening employees and members of the public. Phishing threats against employees can lead to severe security incidents, whereas those against the public can undermine trust, satisfaction, and brand equity. At the root of the problem is the inability of Internet users to identify phishing attacks even when using anti-phishing tools. We propose the phishing funnel model (PFM), a framework for predicting user susceptibility to phishing websites. PFM incorporates user, threat, and tool-related factors to predict actions during four key stages of the phishing process: visit, browse, consider legitimate, and intention to transact. We evaluated the efficacy of PFM in a 12-month longitudinal field experiment in two organizations involving 1,278 employees and 49,373 phishing interactions. PFM significantly outperformed competing models in terms of its ability to predict user susceptibility to phishing attacks. A follow-up three-month field study revealed that employees using PFM were significantly less likely to interact with phishing threats relative to comparison models and baseline warnings. Results of a cost-benefit analysis suggest that interventions guided by PFM could reduce annual phishing-related costs by nearly $1,900 per employee relative to comparison prediction methods.},

   abstract                      = {With peer-to-peer sharing of durable goods like cars, boats, and condominiums, it is unclear how manufacturers should react. They could seek to encourage these markets or compete against them by offering their own rentals. This work shows why the best business model depends on whether consumer usage rates vary or not. Contrary to what might be expected, this paper shows that manufacturers have an incentive to facilitate transactions of P2P rental markets in a large variety of cases. We find that when consumer variation in usage rates is intermediate, the manufacturer is surprisingly best off avoiding offering its own direct rentals option and instead, facilitating a peer-to-peer rental market where consumers can share among themselves. The reason for this is an effect unique to the sharing economy, the equalizing effect. The equalizing effect shows that peer-to-peer rentals uniquely make previously heterogeneous willingness-to-pay among consumers more similar, making it easier for the firm to discriminate between the higher- and lower-value consumers, thus allowing it to extract a higher portion of consumers’ surplus. Surprisingly, there are some cases where peer-to-peer rentals benefit the manufacturer, but consumers are hurt overall (though the lower-usage consumers do always benefit from the availability of peer-to-peer rentals).},

One of the major verticals that has recently begun to effectively use IoT technologies is the retail industry. Given the unprecedented opportunities IoT generates for brands and retailers, it is important to glean timely insights regarding the business value of IoT and understand whether the introduction of an IoT technology as an alternative purchase channel for consumers affects the sales of physical products. Using empirical data from a multinational online retailer who adopted an IoT technology that largely automates the consumers’ purchases and employing a quasi-experimental framework, we study the effect of the introduction of IoT as an alternative sales channel on product sales. Our analyses reveal a statistically and economically significant increase in sales and demonstrate the business value of the IoT channel for retailers and brands. In addition, we conduct other analyses of IoT to delve into the effect of heterogeneity and empirically validate the underlying mechanisms by examining the impact of IoT for products in different price ranges, levels of substitutability, and product categories. For instance, our analyses reveal that less expensive and more differentiated products, as well as experience and utilitarian goods, can accrue higher benefits leveraging more effectively novel IoT technologies. This is the first paper to study the impact of an IoT technology on product sales, drawing important implications for devices and technologies largely automating the purchase process.},

   abstract                      = {Health information exchanges (HIEs) are entities that have emerged in healthcare delivery markets across the United States. By providing an interorganizational information system (IOIS) and governance over use of this system and the information exchanged through it, HIEs enable more routine and efficient electronic sharing of patient information between disparate and fragmented healthcare providers. This should result in improved quality and efficiency of care. However, significant questions persist about the extent to which HIEs produce these benefits in practice, particularly in terms of reducing healthcare spending. We use transaction cost economics (TCE) to theorize that HIEs establish a quasi-hierarchy that decreases frictions associated with information sharing in ways that reduce healthcare spending, and that the magnitude of reductions is greater when (1) insurer and provider incentives align, and (2) HIE capabilities mature. We can test these conjectures because HIEs, unlike other efforts that provide IOIS, are typically confined to regional markets and develop heterogeneously between these markets, introducing variation in insurer-provider incentive alignment and HIE maturity. Leveraging a unique national panel data set, we evaluate whether HIEs reduce spending for the largest insurer in the United States, i.e., Medicare, and whether incentives and HIE maturity modify the magnitude of reductions. We find significant spending reductions in healthcare markets that have established operational HIEs, with an average reduction of $139 per Medicare beneficiary per year (1.4% decrease) or a $3.12 billion annual reduction in spending if HIEs were nationally implemented in 2015. We also find that these reductions occur disproportionately in healthcare markets where providers have financial incentives to use an HIE to reduce spending and when HIEs are more mature. Our results inform an important open empirical question in the healthcare domain related to the value of HIEs, while also joining perspectives from TCE with the IOIS literature to understand the factors that may be relevant to IOIS value creation more generally.},

Much research has focused on advancing recommendation technologies to improve accuracy of predictions, although behavioral aspects of using recommender systems are often overlooked. In our studies, we explore how consumer preferences at the time of consumption are impacted by predictions generated by recommender systems. We conducted three controlled laboratory experiments to explore the effects of system recommendations on preferences. Studies 1 and 2 investigated user preferences for television programs across a variety of conditions, which were surveyed immediately following program viewing. Study 3 investigated the granularity of the observed effects within individual participants. Results provide strong evidence that the rating presented by a recommender system serves as an anchor for the consumer's constructed preference. Viewers' preference ratings are malleable and can be significantly influenced by the recommendation received. The effect is sensitive to the perceived reliability of a recommender system and, thus, not a purely numerical or priming-based effect. Finally, the effect of anchoring is continuous and linear, operating over a range of perturbations of the system. These general findings have a number of important implications (e.g., on recommender systems performance metrics and design, preference bias, potential strategic behavior, and trust), which are discussed.},

Prior research has focused largely on computational approaches to improving recommendation accuracy, and only recently researchers have started to study their behavioral implications and potential side effects. We used three controlled experiments, in the context of purchasing digital songs, to explore the willingness-to-pay judgments of individual consumers after being shown personalized recommendations. In Study 1, we found strong evidence that randomly assigned song recommendations affected participants’ willingness to pay, even when controlling for participants’ preferences and demographics. In Study 2, participants viewed actual system-generated recommendations that were intentionally perturbed (introducing recommendation error), and we observed similar effects. In Study 3, we showed that the influence of personalized recommendations on willingness-to-pay judgments was obtained even when preference uncertainty was reduced through immediate and mandatory song sampling prior to pricing. The results demonstrate the existence of important economic side effects of personalized recommender systems and inform our understanding of how system recommendations can influence our everyday preference judgments. The findings have significant implications for the design and application of recommender systems as well as for online retail practices.

   abstract                      = {Many auctions involve selling several distinct items simultaneously, where bidders can bid on the whole or any part of the lot. Such auctions are referred to as combinatorial auctions. Examples of such auctions include truck delivery routes, industrial procurement, and FCC spectrum. Determining winners in such auctions is an NP-hard problem, and significant research is being conducted in this area. However, multiple-round (iterative) combinatorial auctions present significant challenges in bid formulations as well. Because the combinatorial dynamics in iterative auctions can make a given bid part of a winning and nonwinning set of bids without any changes in the bid, bidders are usually not able to evaluate whether they should revise their bid at a given point in time or not. Therefore, in this paper we address various computational problems that are relevant from the bidder's perspective. In particular, we introduce two bid evaluation metrics that can be used by bidders to determine whether any given bid can be a part of the winning allocation and explore their theoretical properties. Based on these metrics, we also develop efficient data structures and algorithms that provide comprehensive information about the current state of the auction at any time, which can help bidders in evaluating their bids and bidding strategies. Our approach uses exponential memory storage but provides fast incremental update for new bids, thereby facilitating bidder support for real-time iterative combinatorial auctions.},

Using limited information provided by the mechanism, we design strategies for software agents to make bids intelligently. In particular, we derive analytical results for the important characteristics of the auction, which allow estimation of the key parameters; we then use these theoretical results to design several bidding strategies. We demonstrate the validity of designed strategies using a discrete event simulation model that resembles the mechanisms used in treasury bills auctions, business-to-consumer (B2C) auctions, and auctions for environmental emission allowances. In addition, using the data generated by the simulation model, we show that intelligent strategies can provide a high probability of winning an auction without significant loss in surplus.},

However, the types of recommendations available to the users in these recommender systems are typically determined by the vendor and therefore are not flexible. In this paper, we address this problem by presenting the recommendation query language REQUEST that allows users to customize recommendations by formulating them in the ways satisfying personalized needs of the users. REQUEST is based on the multidimensional model of recommender systems that supports additional contextual dimensions besides traditional User and Item dimensions and also OLAP-type aggregation and filtering capabilities. This paper also presents the recommendation algebra RA, shows how REQUEST recommendations can be mapped into this algebra, and analyzes the expressive power of the query language and the algebra. This paper also shows how users can customize their recommendations using REQUEST queries through a series of examples.},

In this spirit, I examine the intellectual structure and evolution of one disciplinary journal, ISR, over the most recent four-year period (2012–2015). I use a census of citation data and classify journals citing ISR and cited by ISR into the disciplines they represent. Analyzing 12,833 citations to ISR from 100 journals, and 7,731 citations from ISR to papers published in 67 journals I find that, consistent with prior studies, ISR reflects the multidisciplinarity of the information systems (IS) discipline, its boundaries are expanding to include new disciplines, and the journal draws extensively on other IS journals. I raise some questions for further introspection about the impact and visibility of IS research.},

There are large geographic variations, as well as variations across ethnic and racial lines. Prior research suggests that individual, household, and regional differences are responsible for this disparity. We argue for an alternative explanation: Individual choice is subject to social influence (“peer effects”) that emanates from geographic proximity; this influence is the cause of the excess variation. We test this assertion with empirical analysis of a data set compiled from a number of sources. We find, first, that widespread Internet use among people who live in proximity has a direct effect on an individual's propensity to go online. Using data on residential segregation, we test the proposition that the Internet usage patterns of people who live in more ethnically isolated regions will more closely resemble usage patterns of their ethnic group. Finally, we examine the moderating impact of housing density and directly measured social interactions on the relationship between Internet use and peer effects. Results are consistent across analyses and provide strong evidence of peer effects, suggesting that individual Internet use is influenced by local patterns of usage. Implications for public policy and the diffusion of the Internet are discussed.},

Although health IT (HIT) has tremendous potential to improve quality and reduce costs in healthcare, significant challenges need to be overcome to fully realize this potential. In this commentary, we survey the landscape of existing studies on HIT to provide an overview of the current status of HIT research. We then identify three major areas that warrant further research: (1) HIT design, implementation, and meaningful use; (2) measurement and quantification of HIT payoff and impact; and (3) extending the traditional realm of HIT. We discuss specific research questions in each domain and suggest appropriate methods to approach them. We encourage information systems scholars to become active participants in the global discourse on health-care transformation through IT.},

We find that competing high-quality ads, appearing above the focal ad, have a lower negative effect on the click performance as compared to competing low-quality ads. We also find that this effect of competing ads varies with the ad position and the type of keyword. In general, the negative effect of competing high-quality ads decreases at low positions as compared to high positions. Furthermore, this decrease in the negative effect of competing high-quality ads is more substantial for specific keywords. Our results reveal consumer behavior in evaluating different quality ads in sponsored search. More specifically, our results suggest that consumers use the presence of high-quality competing ads as a signal of higher quality of the focal ad. Our findings can help advertisers better evaluate their relative performance for different positions for various types of keywords. This can also help evaluate the efficacy of the auction design mechanism.},

This paper extends current understanding about the concept of self-efficacy in the context of computer software. We describe how two broad types of computer self-efficacy beliefs, general self-efficacy and task-specific self-efficacy, are constructed across different computing tasks by suggesting that initial general CSE beliefs will strongly predict subsequent specific CSE beliefs. The theorized causal relationships illustrate the malleability and development of CSE beliefs over time, within a training environment where individuals are progressively provided with greater opportunity for hands-on experience and practice with different software. Consistent with the findings of prior research, judgments of self-efficacy then serve as key antecedents of the perceived cognitive effort (ease of use) associated with technology usage. Further, we theorize that self-efficacy judgments in the task domain of computing are strongly influenced by the extent to which individuals believe that they are personally innovative with respect to information technology. Panel data were collected using a longitudinal research design within a training context where 186 subjects were taught two software packages in a sequential manner over a 14-week period. The emergent patterns of the hypothesized relationships are examined using structural equation modeling techniques. Results largely support the relationships posited.},

In this paper, we describe a heuristic evaluation procedure for examining the usability of Web sites. The procedure utilizes a comprehensive set of usability guidelines developed by Microsoft. We present the categories and subcategories comprising these guidelines, and 7discuss the development of an instrument that operationalizes the measurement of usability. The proposed instrument was tested in a heuristic evaluation study where 1,475 users rated multiple Web sites from four different industry sectors: airlines, online bookstores, automobile manufacturers, and car rental agencies. To enhance the external validity of the study, users were asked to assume the role of a consumer or an investor when assessing usability. Empirical results suggest that the evaluation procedure, the instrument, as well as the usability metric exhibit good properties. Implications of the findings for researchers, for Web site designers, and for heuristic evaluation methods in usability testing are offered.},

   abstract                      = {External financing is critical to ventures that do not have a revenue source but need to recruit employees, develop products, pay suppliers, and market their products/services. There is an increasing belief among entrepreneurs that electronic word-of-mouth (eWOM), specifically blog coverage, can aid in achieving venture capital financing. Conflicting findings reported by past studies examining eWOM make it unclear what to make of such beliefs of entrepreneurs. Even if there were generally agreed-upon results, a stream of literature indicates that because of the differences in traits between the prior investigated contexts and venture capital financing, the findings from the prior studies cannot be generalized to venture capital financing. Extant studies also fall short in examining the role of time and the status of entities generating eWOM in determining the influence of eWOM on decision making. To address this dearth of literature in a context that attracts billions of dollars every year, we investigate the effect of eWOM on venture capital financing. This study entails the challenging task of gathering data from hundreds of ventures along with other sources including VentureXpert, surveys, Google Blogsearch, Lexis-Nexis, and Archive.org. The key findings of our econometric analysis are that the impact of negative eWOM is greater than is the impact of positive eWOM and that the effect of eWOM on financing decreases with the progress through the financing stages. We also find that the eWOM of popular bloggers helps ventures in getting higher funding amounts and valuations. The empirical model used in this work accounts for inherent selection biases of entrepreneurs and venture capitalists, and we conduct numerous robustness checks for potential issues of endogeneity, selection bias, nonlinearities, and popularity cutoff for blogs. The findings have important implications for entrepreneurs and suggest ways by which entrepreneurs can take advantage of eWOM.},

Although a number of companies realize the potential of blogs and encourage their employees to blog, a good chunk of them are skeptical about losing control over this new media. Companies fear that employees may write negative things about them and that this may bring significant reputation loss. Overall, companies show mixed response toward negative posts on employee blogs—some companies show complete aversion; others allow some negative posts. Such mixed reactions toward negative posts motivated us to probe for any positive aspects of negative posts. In particular, we investigate the relationship between negative posts and readership of an employee blog. In contrast to the popular perception, our results reveal a potential positive aspect of negative posts. Our analysis suggests that negative posts act as catalyst and can exponentially increase the readership of employee blogs, suggesting that companies should permit employees to make negative posts. Because employees typically write few negative posts and largely write positive posts, the increase in readership of employee blogs generally should be enough to offset the negative effect of few negative posts. Therefore, not restraining negative posts to increase readership should be a good strategy. This raises a logical question: what should a firm's policy be regarding employee blogging? For exposition, we suggest an analytical framework using our empirical model.},

The idea generation process is simultaneously influenced by multiple activities: knowledge acquisition from participants’ interactions with each other’s ideas, deliberate practice through persistent participation, and learning through failures. Due to the dynamic interplay across these activities, it is challenging to identify each activity’s influence on creative ideation outcomes using reduced-form regression analysis. To overcome these challenges, we employ a comprehensive empirical framework, the mutually exciting spatiotemporal point process model with unobserved heterogeneity, which endogenizes the occurrences of these activities in continuous time and allows for user-dependent effects. By utilizing the activity stream data of 13,028 participants from 2010 to 2016 in an open innovation platform, we uncovered synergistic effects of these activities on creative outcomes. We find that knowledge acquired through interaction with others (i.e., stimulus ideas) plays a vital role in the creative ideation process, but their effect is more nuanced than what we have known so far. In contrast to the prior belief that distant analogies, stimulus ideas outside of a problem domain, spur creativity, we find that distant analogies lead to failures. Yet, we further find that such failures are indispensable to the creative ideation process because failures motivate idea generators (1) to acquire more knowledge by increasing their future interactions with other participants’ ideas (learning from others), and (2) to persist in generating ideas that lead to improvements in their ability to apply the acquired knowledge and to identify innovation tasks that are relevant to their stock of acquired knowledge (learning by doing). Our results indicate that failures are a stronger driver of the learning activities than successes. Based on our findings, we offer insights on how to cultivate creativity in an open innovation setting.},

This is particularly important in contexts where the user base may be non-IT professionals—i.e., the users may vary substantially in their basic IT knowledge. We draw on psychology to argue that in situations where there is a wide variance in actual IT knowledge, there will often exist a U-shaped relationship between actual and self-perceived IT knowledge such that the least knowledgeable believe themselves to be highly knowledgeable. We then draw on individual-level adoption theories to argue that users with high self-perceived IT knowledge will be more likely to adopt new technologies and do so faster. We also draw on individual-level continuance theories to argue that users with low actual IT knowledge will be more likely to discontinue using new technologies and do so faster. We test our expectations using a proprietary data set of 225 sales professionals in a large Indian pharmaceutical company that is testing a new customer relationship management system. We find strong support for our hypotheses.},

We highlight that the shutdown additionally had important unintended externalities. Individuals who never visited kino.to and who additionally clicked on news articles that covered the shutdown increased their visits to piracy websites substantially. We show that this effect largely comes from articles that explicitly mention alternative websites or suggest that users do not have to fear legal consequences from unlicensed streaming. Finally, we document that the unlicensed video streaming market is much more fragmented after the shutdown, potentially affecting future interventions, at least in the short run. We argue that our results can be helpful to understand why online piracy rates are still high, despite a plethora of enforcement efforts.},

   abstract                      = {Information systems researchers have recently begun to propose models that include formatively specified constructs, and largely rely on partial least squares (PLS) to estimate the parameters of interest in those models. In this research, we focus on those cases where the formatively specified constructs are endogenous to other constructs in the research model in addition to their own manifest indicators, which are quite common in published research in the discipline, and analyze whether PLS is a valid statistical technique for estimating those models. Although there is evidence that covariance-based approaches can accurately estimate them, this is the first research that examines whether PLS can indeed do so. Through a theoretical analysis based on the inner workings of the PLS algorithm, which is later validated and extended through a series of Monte Carlo simulations, we conclude that is not the case. Specifically, estimates obtained from PLS are capturing something other than the relationship of interest when the formatively specified constructs are endogenous to others in the model. We show how our results apply more generally to a class of models, and discuss implications for future research practice.},

   abstract                      = {When algorithms use data generated by human beings, they inherit the errors stemming from human biases, which likely diminishes their performance. We examine the design and value of a bias-aware linear classification algorithm that accounts for bias in input data, using breast cancer diagnosis as our specific setting. In this context, a referring physician makes a follow-up recommendation to a patient based on two inputs: the patient’s clinical-risk information and the radiologist’s mammogram assessment. Critically, the radiologist’s assessment could be biased by the clinical-risk information, which in turn can negatively affect the referring physician’s performance. Thus, a bias-aware algorithm has the potential to be of significant value if integrated into a clinical decision support system used by the referring physician. We develop and show that a bias-aware algorithm can eliminate the adverse impact of bias if the error in the mammogram assessment due to radiologist’s bias has no variance. On the other hand, in the presence of error variance, the adverse impact of bias can be mitigated, but not eliminated, by the bias-aware algorithm. The bias-aware algorithm assigns less (more) weight to the clinical-risk information (radiologist’s mammogram assessment) when the mean error increases (decreases), but the reverse happens when the error variance increases. Using point estimates obtained from mammography practice and the medical literature, we show that the bias-aware algorithm can significantly improve the expected patient life years or the accuracy of decisions based on mammography.

To investigate whether privacy uncertainty continues to be a factor after a consumer has already started using an app, we conducted a survey of users of wellness and personal finance apps. The results indicate that privacy uncertainty is a lingering concern because it continues to influence a user’s intention to continue using an app and the perceived risk associated with that continued use.},

   abstract                      = {Reusing database queries by adapting them to satisfy new information requests is an attractive strategy for extracting information from databases without involving database specialists. However, the reuse of information systems artifacts has been shown to be susceptible to the phenomenon of anchoring and adjustment. Anchoring often leads to a systematic adjustment bias in which people fail to make sufficient changes to an anchor in response to the needs of a new task. In a study involving 157 novice query writers from six universities, we examined the effect of this phenomenon on the reuse of Structured Query Language (SQL) queries under varying levels of domain familiarity and for different types of anchors. Participants developed SQL queries to respond to four information requests in a familiar domain and four information requests in an unfamiliar domain. For two information requests in each domain, participants were also provided with sample queries (anchors) that answered similar information requests. We found evidence that the opportunity to reuse sample queries resulted in an adjustment bias leading to poorer quality query results and greater overconfidence in the correctness of results. The results also indicate that the strength of the adjustment bias depends on a combination of domain familiarity and type of anchor. This study demonstrates that anchoring and adjustment during query reuse can lead to queries that are less accurate than those written from scratch. We also extend the concept of anchoring and adjustment by distinguishing between surface-structure and deep-structure anchors and by considering the impact of domain familiarity on the adjustment bias.},

E-tailers can track items in online shopping carts and radio frequency identification tags enable retailers to do the same in brick-and-mortar stores. To leverage this information, it is important to understand how this new visibility impacts pricing and market outcomes. We propose a model in which a seller sets prices for goods A and B, allowing for the possibility of sequentially revising the price for good B if the buyer reveals a preference for good A by making an initial purchase decision. We derive comparative statics results for the prices of products that have superadditive or subadditive values, and also for the associated profits. We also run simulations for a range of distributions of buyer values, to compare sequential pricing with mixed bundling. The results indicate that information technology-enabled sequential pricing can increase profits relative to mixed bundling or pure components pricing for substitute goods due to a reduction of intraseller competition. We also consider the case of goods with positively or negatively correlated values and find that when sellers can condition the second good's price on the buyer's decision to purchase the first good, sequential pricing increases profits when customer's values for the goods are highly positively correlated.},

   abstract                      = {In the past decade, the proliferation of online marketplace lending has been disrupting the consumer credit market, especially for personal loans for debt consolidation. These lenders, for example, Lending Club, transcend the geographic boundaries within which local banks operate and offer homogeneous access and terms to borrowers. However, the ultimate benefits borrowers derive from marketplace lending can differ significantly because local alternatives may replace marketplace loans when available and favorable. Correspondingly, if local bank competition drives the substitution of an existing marketplace loan with a traditional bank loan, the promise of equal benefits to all borrowers from marketplace lending is unlikely to fully materialize. This competitive dynamic has implications for policy making, particularly in judging the ramifications of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Our results indicate that a borrower who resides in a more competitive market is more likely to pay off a P2P loan early by making a large, one-time payment compared with a borrower from a less competitive market, indicating a substitution with a local bank loan. Thus, borrowers from different markets do not benefit equally from online marketplace lending, disrupting the consumer credit market. In particular, consumers in smaller markets continue to be disadvantaged because of the absence of competitive intensity. This is a consequence of traditional banks competing within their local markets and incentivized to attract marketplace borrowers to traditional loans primarily by their local market conditions. Therefore, unless geographic frictions in traditional lending markets are removed, digital disruptions cannot equalize the benefits to consumers.},

Review platforms have responded by developing tools and algorithms to identify potentially fraudulent reviews. But the question remains: What should platforms do with fraudulent reviews after detecting them? Our research answers this question using randomized experiments and large-scale data analysis from Yelp’s review platform. Our results show that after detecting fraudulent reviews, platforms should keep them on their platforms, but should display them with a flag that identifies them as potentially fraudulent. Doing so will increase consumers' trust in the platform by demonstrating that the platform takes fraud serious and will also penalize dishonest businesses. Together, these results provide strong managerial and policy guidance to developing truthful, transparent, and accountable online ecosystems. Our research topic is particularly timely given the presence of misinformation on technology platforms, the incentives of actors to exploit anonymity to manipulate consumer beliefs, and the influence these actions can have on consumer trust.},

We pose the question: under what circumstances will individuals be willing to disclose identified personal health information and permit it to be digitized? Using privacy boundary theory and recent developments in the literature related to risk-as-feelings as the core conceptual foundation, we propose and test a model explicating the role played by type of information requested (general health, mental health, genetic), the purpose for which it is to be used (patient care, research, marketing), and the requesting stakeholder (doctors/hospitals, the government, pharmaceutical companies) in an individual's willingness to disclose personal health information. Furthermore, we explore the impact of emotion linked to one's health condition on willingness to disclose. Results from a nationally representative sample of over 1,000 adults underscore the complexity of the health information disclosure decision and show that emotion plays a significant role, highlighting the need for re-examining the timing of consent. Theoretically, the study extends the dominant cognitive-consequentialist approach to privacy by incorporating the role of emotion. It further refines the privacy calculus to incorporate the moderating influence of contextual factors salient in the healthcare setting. The practical implications of this study include an improved understanding of consumer concerns and potential impacts regarding the electronic storage of health information that can be used to craft policy.},

High performance is a selling point for consumers, but in many cases it requires developers to make large investments to participate. Abstracting from an example drawn from the video game industry, we build a strategic model to investigate the trade-off between investing in high platform performance versus reducing investment in order to facilitate third party content development. We carry out a full analysis of three distinct settings: monopoly, price-setting duopoly, and price-taking duopoly. We provide insights on the optimum investment in platform performance and demonstrate how conventional wisdom about product development may be misleading in the presence of strong cross-network externalities. In particular, we show that, contrary to the conventional wisdom about “winner-take-all” markets, heavily investing in the core performance of a platform does not always yield a competitive edge. We characterize the conditions under which offering a platform with lower performance but greater availability of content can be a winning strategy.},

This study examines competition among firms in online sponsored search markets—one of the fastest growing and most competitive of online markets. We develop and test a model that predicts the clickthrough rate (CTR) of a seller's listing in a sponsored search setting. Drawing on consumer search theory and competitive positioning strategies, we theorize that CTR is jointly driven by a seller's positioning strategy as reflected by the unique selling proposition (USP) in its “ad creative,” by its rank in a sponsored search listing, and by the nature of competition around the focal firm's listing. We use data from a field experiment conducted by a leading firm in the mortgage industry where the firm varied its rank and USP dynamically. Results suggest that sponsored search listings can act as effective customer segmentation mechanisms, consistent with a model of consumer search in directional markets. We further find that the effect on CTR of a firm's positioning strategy and its rank in a listing is strongly moderated by its ability to differentiate itself from adjacent rivals. We discuss the implications of our findings for sellers' strategies in sponsored search markets and for extending the understanding of consumer search behavior in directional markets.},

We find that (1) more multitasking is associated with more project output, but diminishing marginal returns, and (2) recruiters whose network contacts have heterogeneous knowledge—an even distribution of expertise over many project types—are less productive on average but more productive when juggling diverse multitasking portfolios. These results show how multitasking affects productivity and how knowledge networks, enabled by IT, can improve worker performance.

   abstract                      = {Increasingly, new forms of organizing for knowledge production are built around self-organizing coproduction community models with ambiguous role definitions. Current theories struggle to explain how high-quality knowledge is developed in these settings and how participants self-organize in the absence of role definitions, traditional organizational controls, or formal coordination mechanisms. In this article, we engage the puzzle by investigating the temporal dynamics underlying emergent roles on individual and organizational levels. Comprised of a multilevel large-scale empirical study of Wikipedia stretching over a decade, our study investigates emergent roles in terms of prototypical activity patterns that organically emerge from individuals’ knowledge production actions. Employing a stratified sample of 1,000 Wikipedia articles, we tracked 200,000 distinct participants and 700,000 coproduction activities, and recorded each activity’s type. We found that participants’ role-taking behavior is turbulent across roles, with substantial flow in and out of coproduction work. Our findings at the organizational level, however, show that work is organized around a highly stable set of emergent roles, despite the absence of traditional stabilizing mechanisms such as predefined work procedures or role expectations. This dualism in emergent work is conceptualized as “turbulent stability.” We attribute the stabilizing factor to the artifact-centric production process and present evidence to illustrate the mutual adjustment of role taking according to the artifact’s needs and stage. We discuss the importance of the affordances of Wikipedia in enabling such tacit coordination. This study advances our theoretical understanding of the nature of emergent roles and self-organizing knowledge coproduction. We discuss the implications for custodians of online communities as well as for managers of firms engaging in self-organized knowledge collaboration.},

Despite significant investments in information technology, considerable diversity exists in how well firms have been able to assimilate IT and leverage the business value of IT. This research draws upon the emerging knowledge-based and resource-based views of the firm to examine the influence of three factors on IT assimilation: (i) quality of senior leadership, (ii) sophistication of IT infrastructures, and (iii) organizational size. Drawing upon a large-scale sample survey where responses were obtained from CIOs and senior business executives who were members of the firms' top management teams, the study examines a variety of mostly normative prescriptions. The findings provide robust evidence about the impacts of CIOs' business and IT knowledge on IT assimilation. Further, we find that CIOs' membership in top management teams and their informal interactions with TMT members enhance their knowledge, particularly their business knowledge. We find that the intensity of the relationship between CIO's interactions with the top management team and their level of IT and business knowledge is much stronger in firms that articulate a transformational IT vision. The sophistication of IT infrastructures was also found to significantly impact IT assimilation. Surprisingly, the IT knowledge of senior business executives was not found to be a significant influence on IT assimilation. The implications of these findings for evolving a deeper understanding of the dynamics underlying IT assimilation are presented.},

Further, there is no systematic evidence on how incremental automation over time and across multiple wards impacts the rate of medical errors. The primary objective of our study is to fill this gap in the literature by empirically examining how the automation of core error prevention functions affects two types of medical errors. We draw on the medical informatics literature and principal-agency theory and use a unique panel data set of actual documented medical errors from two major hospitals to analyze the interplay between automation and medical errors. We hypothesize that the automation of the sensing function (recording and observing agent actions) will have the greatest impact on reducing error rates. We show that there are significant complementarities between quality management training imparted to hospital staff and the automation of control systems in reducing interpretative medical errors. We also offer insights to practitioners and theoreticians alike on how the automation of error prevention functions can be combined with training in quality management to yield better outcomes. Our results suggest an optimal implementation path for the automation of error prevention functions in hospitals.},

An important consideration in this debate is the behavior of software vendors. How quickly do vendors patch vulnerabilities and how does disclosure affect patch release time? This paper compiles a unique data set from the Computer Emergency Response Team/Coordination Center (CERT) and SecurityFocus to answer this question. Our results suggest that disclosure accelerates patch release. The instantaneous probability of releasing the patch rises by nearly two and a half times because of disclosure. Open source vendors release patches more quickly than closed source vendors. Vendors are more responsive to more severe vulnerabilities. We also find that vendors respond more slowly to vulnerabilities not disclosed by CERT. We verify our results by using another publicly available data set and find that results are consistent. We also show how our estimates can aid policy makers in their decision making.},

This fluid process dramatically speeds up exploration and provides a better understanding of the relative impact of the component criteria.

We present a formal model of pricing models in online advertising using the principal–agent framework to study the two most popular pricing models: input-based cost per thousand impressions (CPM) and performance-based cost per click-through (CPC). We identify four important factors that affect the preference of CPM to the CPC model, and vice versa. In particular, we highlight the interplay between uncertainty in the decision environment, value of advertising, cost of mistargeting advertisements, and alignment of incentives. These factors shed light on the preferred online-advertising pricing model for publishers and advertisers under different market conditions.},

   abstract                      = {Peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing networks are an important medium for the distribution of information goods. However, there is little empirical research into the optimal design of these networks under real-world conditions. Early speculation about the behavior of P2P networks has focused on the role that positive network externalities play in improving performance as the network grows. However, negative network externalities also arise in P2P networks because of the consumption of scarce network resources or an increased propensity of users to free ride in larger networks, and the impact of these negative network externalities—while potentially important—has received far less attention. Our research addresses this gap in understanding by measuring the impact of both positive and negative network externalities on the optimal size of P2P networks. Our research uses a unique dataset collected from the six most popular OpenNap P2P networks between December 19, 2000, and April 22, 2001. We find that users contribute additional value to the network at a decreasing rate and impose costs on the network at an increasing rate, while the network increases in size. Our results also suggest that users are less likely to contribute resources to the network as the network size increases. Together, these results suggest that the optimal size of these centralized P2P networks is bounded—At some point the costs that a marginal user imposes on the network will exceed the value they provide to the network. This finding is in contrast to early predictions that larger P2P networks would always provide more value to users than smaller networks. Finally, these results also highlight the importance of considering user incentives—an important determinant of resource sharing in P2P networks—in network design.},

To analyze the relationship between IT use and firm-level employment, we examine the longitudinal role of IT use in the firm’s total number of employees. Our data set comes from the emerging economy of Turkey, and it represents firms of different sizes and industries. The data capture the firm’s use of enterprise applications, such as enterprise resource planning and customer relationship management, and the use of Web applications, such as e-banking and e-government. Our empirical specifications exploit both within-firm and between-firm variations to show the positive effect of IT use on firm-level employment, which varies across IT applications over time. Interestingly, we find that the effects of the use of enterprise applications materialize after two years, whereas the effects of the use of Web applications are realized in the current year. We also examine whether the role of IT use in firm-level employment are moderated by firm size, average wage rate, and industry technology intensity. The long-term effects of the use of enterprise applications on firm-level employment are more pronounced in larger firms, with higher average wages, and in high-technology industries. The results are robust to alternative specifications and tests that address causality and endogeneity concerns. Implications for research, practice, and public policy are discussed.},

   abstract                      = {Job erosion is a major concern globally, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment and low wages remain pressing societal challenges in the wake of increased automation, more so for traditionally disadvantaged groups in the labor market, such as women, minorities, and the elderly. However, workers who possess relevant information technology (IT) skills may have an edge in an increasingly digital economy. In this study, we examine the role of IT skills in labor market outcomes for workers, using a household IT use survey from an emerging economy that captures detailed, individual-level data on IT skills, which are also integrated with data on workers’ wages, occupations, and industries between 2007 and 2015. The results indicate that basic IT skills increase individuals’ employment probability, which is driven by both higher labor force participation and a higher probability of transitioning from unemployment to employment, after accounting for the decision to participate in the workforce. Advanced IT skills do not provide a significant incremental effect on employment probability on top of basic IT skills. However, having advanced IT skills helps workers to earn higher wages while incrementally increasing the probability that they are employed in higher-paid jobs. Interestingly, the effect of basic IT skills on employment is significantly larger for the female and older workforce that typically has a higher preference for flexible work options. These results emphasize the importance of providing necessary IT access and offering basic IT training to traditionally disadvantaged groups to close the IT skills gap and the digital divide. We offer implications for the future of work, education, and public policy for designing IT training policies for workers, students, and organizations to stimulate employment with higher wages, particularly in developing economies and for traditionally disadvantaged segments of the workforce, such as women and the elderly, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic.},

This can greatly increase the value associated with the software. In an environment where negative security externalities are present and users make complex consumption and patching decisions, we construct a model that clarifies whether and how SaaS versions should be offered by vendors. We find that the existence of version-specific security externalities is sufficient to warrant a versioned outcome, which has been shown to be suboptimal in the absence of security risks. In high security-loss environments, we find that SaaS should be geared to the middle tier of the consumer market if patching costs and the quality of the SaaS offering are high, and geared to the lower tier otherwise. In the former case, when security risk associated with each version is endogenously determined by consumption choices, strategic interactions between the vendor and consumers may cause a higher tier consumer segment to prefer a lower inherent quality product. Relative to on-premises benchmarks, we find that software diversification leads to lower average security losses for users when patching costs are high. However, when patching costs are low, surprisingly, average security losses can increase as a result of SaaS offerings and lead to lower consumer surplus. We also investigate the vendor’s security investment decision and establish that, as the market becomes riskier, the vendor tends to increase investments in an on-premises version and decrease investments in a SaaS version. On the other hand, in low security-loss environments, we find that SaaS is optimally targeted to a lower tier of the consumer market, average security losses decrease, and consumer surplus increases as a result. Security investments increase for both software versions as risk increases in these environments.},

In this paper we study the role of services in open source software development and explore the choice between open source and proprietary software. Specifically, our economic model jointly analyzes the investment and pricing decisions of the originators of software and of subsequent open-source contributors. We find that if a contributor is efficient in software development, the originator should adopt an open-source strategy, allowing the contributor to offer higher total quality and capture the higher end of the market while the originator focuses on providing software services to lower end consumers. Conversely, if the contributor is not efficient in development, the originator should adopt a proprietary software development strategy, gaining revenue from software sales and squeezing the contributor out of the services market. In certain cases an increase in originator development efficiency can result in increased contributor profits. Finally, we find that, somewhat counterintuitively, an increase in contributor development efficiency can reduce overall social welfare.},

In this study, we present an economic model to study how software licensing attributes affect a software originator’s decisions, aiming to provide policy makers with insights into how welfare-improving, open-source outcomes can be incentivized. We show that when a competing contributor is apt at reaping the benefits of software development investment, a less restrictive open source license (e.g., Berkeley Software Distribution, or BSD style) can improve welfare. On the other hand, when the originator is better at leveraging investment and service costs are high, a more restrictive license (e.g., General Public License, or GPL style) can be best for social welfare even when a contributor can cost-efficiently develop the software.

We present a joint model of network software security and software piracy and contrast two policies that a software vendor can enforce: (i) restriction of security patches only to legitimate users or (ii) provision of access to security patches to all users whether their copies are licensed or not. We find that when the software security risk is high and the piracy enforcement level is low, or when tendency for piracy in the consumer population is high, it is optimal for the vendor to restrict unlicensed users from applying security patches. When piracy tendency in the consumer population is low, applying software security patch restrictions is optimal for the vendor only when the piracy enforcement level is high. If patching costs are sufficiently low, however, an unrestricted patch release policy maximizes vendor profits. We also show that the vendor can use security patch restrictions as a substitute to investment in software security, and this effect can significantly reduce welfare. Furthermore, in certain cases, increased piracy enforcement levels can actually hurt vendor profits. We also show that governments can increase social surplus and intellectual property protection simultaneously by increasing piracy enforcement and utilizing the strategic interaction of piracy patch restrictions and network security. Finally, we demonstrate that, although unrestricted patching can maximize welfare when the piracy enforcement level is low, contrary to what one might expect, when the piracy enforcement level is high, restricting security patches only to licensed users can be socially optimal.},

This paper derives a formal relationship between deadline-setting policies and software product quality. It shows that: (1) adding slack does not always preserve quality, thus, systematically adding slack is an incomplete policy for minimizing costs; (2) costs can be minimized by adopting policies that permit estimates of completion dates and deadlines that are different and; (3) contrary to casual intuition, shortcut-taking can be eliminated by setting deadlines aggressively, thereby maintaining or even increasing the time pressures under which developers work.},

Partisans in both research and practice argue for and against plan-based (allegedly inflexible) and agile (allegedly too flexible) approaches. The stakes in this debate are high; questions raised about plan-based approaches undermine longstanding claims that those approaches, when realized, represent maturity of practice. In this commentary, we call for research programs that will move beyond partisan disagreement to a more nuanced discussion, one that takes into account both benefits and costs of flexibility. Key to such programs will be the development of a robust contingency framework for deciding when (in what conditions) plan-based and agile methods should be used. We develop a basic contingency framework in this paper, one that models the benefit/cost economics described in narratives about the transition from craft to industrial production of physical products. We use this framework to demonstrate the power of even a simple model to help us accomplish three objectives: (1) to refocus discussions about the appropriate design of software development processes, concentrating on when to use particular approaches and how they might be usefully combined; (2) to suggest and guide a trajectory of research that can support and enrich this discussion; and (3) to suggest a technology-based explanation for the emergence of agile development at this point in history. Although we are not the first to argue in favor of a contingency perspective, we show that there remain many opportunities for information systems (IS) research to have a major impact on practice in this area.},

Whereas h-service has total costs that increase with the demand for services, e-service mainly requires a fixed investment upfront, which can be amortized over the totality of customers served. Considering the different nature of the costs of h-service and e-service and the heterogeneity of customer preferences for services, we derive the optimal mix of h-service and e-service for a service-providing company vis-à-vis its competitor. Our theoretical analysis finds the subgame-perfect Nash equilibria that determines the optimal positions in a duopoly setting. We further study the competitive dynamics of the system to examine how firms stay on the equilibrium paths. Using simulation, we investigate the effects of starting positions, small adjustments in h-service and/or e-service, and monotonic expansions of e-service on the final positioning and profits of the firms. Our results demonstrate that when firms follow a local best-reply strategy, they may end up in a position of low profitability, and when only monotonic expansions of e-service are allowed, both firms may end up overinvesting in e-service.},

   abstract                      = {The existence and persistence of price dispersion for identical products in online markets have been well-documented in the literature. Possible explanations of this price dispersion, derived mainly using hedonic price models, have seen only modest success. In this paper, we propose a competitive model based on online retailers' differentiation mainly in service provided and recognition enjoyed to explain price dispersion. Our exploratory empirical analyses, using cross-sectional data, demonstrate that the competitive model provides a better explanation of the association between prices and online retailers' service and recognition levels. In addition, our competitive model is able to explain observations that are seemingly inconsistent with the hedonic model such as the negative association between service and price. This paper contributes to the literature on price dispersion by offering a differentiation model that provides a good fit with data and by proposing a theory that explains previous counterintuitive observations of prices. Our model also helps an e-tailer to choose a desirable position in the competitive market.},

Although the extant literature has studied firm level strategic responses to consumer heterogeneity and piracy, there is a lack of understanding of consumer reactions to digital goods choice sets that include firm product extensions such as the introduction of premium or free alternatives. With context-dependent preferences as the theoretical basis, this study systematically examines the impact of piracy controls and product line extensions on welfare in a consumer software market context (i.e., willingness to pay (WTP) and changes in consumer and producer surplus). In two controlled experiments using double-bound-dichotomous-choice WTP elicitation, we investigate how piracy controls and product line extensions impact two different platforms of the same software (PC Adobe applications and mobile Adobe applications) in terms of propensity to pirate and WTP. We show that introducing a premium or free vertical extension has different impacts on consumers’ WTP for the focal product depending on whether it is a low-cost or high-cost market even when controlling for individual differences, such as price fairness perceptions, product feature value, brand perceptions, etc. By contrast, piracy controls reduce piracy rates but have a limited impact on consumer WTP for the focal product in both contexts. By calculating the overall welfare of the market, we show that there is alignment in consumer and producer interests at current and estimated optimal price levels in both high-cost and low-cost markets. However, the introduction of a free product extension leads to a higher surplus in the high-cost market, whereas the introduction of the premium product extension leads to a higher surplus in the low-cost market.},

In particular, we study the retail brokerage sector where the growth of online brokerages and the availability of alternate sources of information and research services have challenged the dominance of traditional brokerages. We develop a stylized game-theoretic model to analyze the impact of competition between an incumbent full-service brokerage firm with a bundled offering of research services and trade execution and an online entrant offering just trade execution. We find that as consumers’ willingness to pay for research declines, the incumbent finds it optimal to unbundle its offering when competing with the online entrant. We also find that the online entrant chooses a lower quality of trade execution when faced with direct competition from the incumbent’s unbundled offering. The analytical model motivates a unique field experiment placing actual simultaneous trades with traditional full-service and online brokers, to compare order handling practices and the quality of trade execution. In keeping with our analytical results, our empirical findings show a significant difference in the quality of execution between online brokerages and their full-service counterparts. We discuss the relevance of our findings for quality differentiation, price convergence, and profit decline in a variety of markets where traditional incumbents are faced with changes in the competitive landscape as a result of e-commerce.},

Electronic networks represent an institutional structure that has resulted from the introduction of information technology in industrial and consumer markets. Ownership of electronic networks is important because it affects the level of network-specific investments, which in turn determine the profitability, and in some cases the viability, of these networks. In our analysis we define an electronic network as a set of participants and a portfolio of assets. The salient concept in this perspective is the degree to which network participants are indispensable in making network assets productive. We derive three main results. First, if one or more assets are essential to all network participants, then all the assets should be owned together. Second, participants that are indispensable to an asset essential to all participants should own all network assets. Third and most important, in the absence of an indispensable participant, and as long as the cooperation of at least two participants is necessary to create value, sole ownership is never the best form of ownership for an electronic network. This latter result implies that as the leading network participants become more dispensable, we should see an evolution toward forms of joint ownership.},

Recently, interorganizational business process standards (IBPS) enabled by information technology (IT) have been suggested as a solution to help organizations overcome this problem. Drawing on three theoretical perspectives, i.e., the relational view of the firm, institutional theory, and organizational inertia theory, we propose three mechanisms—relational, influence, and inertial—to explain the assimilation of IBPS in organizations. We theorize that these mechanisms will have differential effects on the assimilation of IBPS in dominant and nondominant firms. Using a cross-case analysis based on data from 11 firms in the high-tech industry, we found evidence to support our propositions that relational depth, relationship extendability, and normative pressure were important for dominant firms while relational specificity and influence mechanisms (coercive, mimetic, and normative pressures) were important for nondominant firms. Inertial mechanisms, i.e., ability and willingness to overcome resource and routine rigidities, were important for both dominant and nondominant firms.},

Conventional wisdom holds that the viral marketing process is both random and unmanageable. In this paper, we deconstruct the process and investigate the formation of the activated digital network as distinct from the underlying social network. We then consider the impact of the social structure of digital networks (random, scale free, and small world) and of the transmission behavior of individuals on campaign performance. Specifically, we identify alternative social network models to understand the mediating effects of the social structures of these models on viral marketing campaigns. Next, we analyse an actual viral marketing campaign and use the empirical data to develop and validate a computer simulation model for viral marketing. Finally, we conduct a number of simulation experiments to predict the spread of a viral message within different types of social network structures under different assumptions and scenarios. Our findings confirm that the social structure of digital networks play a critical role in the spread of a viral message. Managers seeking to optimize campaign performance should give consideration to these findings before designing and implementing viral marketing campaigns. We also demonstrate how a simulation model is used to quantify the impact of campaign management inputs and how these learnings can support managerial decision making.},

We investigate a class of collaboration software for product design and development called collaborative product commerce (CPC). Drawing on prior research in media richness theory and organizational science, we develop a theoretical framework to study the impact of CPC on product development. Based on data collected from 71 firms, we test our research hypotheses on the impact of CPC on product design quality, design cycle time, and development cost. We find that CPC implementation is associated with greater collaboration among product design teams. This collaboration has a significant, positive impact on product quality and reduces cycle time and product development cost. Further analyses reveal that CPC implementation is associated with substantial cost savings that can be attributed to improvements in product design quality, design turnaround time, greater design reuse, and lower product design documentation and rework costs.},

   abstract                      = {The theory of incomplete contracts has been used to study the relationship between buyers and suppliers following the deployment of modern information technology to facilitate coordination between them. Previous research has sought to explain anecdotal evidence from some industries on the recent reduction in the number of suppliers selected to do business with buyers by appealing to relationship-specific costs that suppliers may incur. In contrast, this paper emphasizes that information technology enables greater completeness of buyer-supplier contracts through more economical monitoring of additional dimensions of supplier performance. The number of terms included in the contract is an imperfect substitute for the number of suppliers. Based on this idea, alternative conditions are identified under which increased use of information technology leads to a reduction in the number of suppliers without invoking relationship-specific costs. We find that a substantial increase in contract completeness due to reduced cost of information technology could increase the cost per supplier even though the cost of coordination and the cost per term monitored decrease. Such an increase in the cost per supplier leads to a reduction in the number of suppliers with whom the buyer chooses to do business. Similarly, we find that if coordination cost is reduced when more information technology is deployed so that the number of suppliers in the buyer’s pool increases substantially, the buyer might choose to make the supplier contracts less complete, instead relying on a more market-oriented approach to finding a supplier with good fit.},

   abstract                      = {The information systems (IS) development activity in large organizations is a source of increasing cost and concern to management. IS development projects are often over-budget, late, costly to maintain, and not done to the satisfaction of the requesting user. These problems exist, in part, due to the organization of the IS development process, where information systems development is typically assigned by the user (principal) to a systems developer (agent). These two parties do not have perfectly congruent goals, and therefore a contract is developed to specify their relationship. An inability to directly monitor the agent requires the use of performance measures, or metrics, to represent the agent's actions to the principal. The use of multiple measures is necessary given the multi-dimensional nature of successful systems development. In practice such contracts are difficult to develop satisfactorily, due in part to an inability to specify appropriate metrics. This paper develops a principal-agent model that provides a set of decision criteria for the principal to use to develop an incentive compatible contract for the agent. These criteria include the precision and the sensitivity of the performance metric. After presenting the formal model, some current software development metrics are discussed to illustrate how the model can be used to provide a theoretical foundation and a formal vocabulary for performance metric analysis. The model is also used in a positive (descriptive) manner to explain why current practice emphasizes metrics that possess relatively high levels of sensitivity and precision. Finally, some suggestions are made for the improvement of current metrics based upon these criteria.},

   abstract                      = {The cost of enhancing software applications to accommodate new and evolving user requirements is significant. Many enhancement cost-reduction initiatives have focused on increasing software structure in applications. However, while software structure can decrease enhancement effort by localizing data processing, increased effort is also required to comprehend structure. Thus, it is not clear whether high levels of software structure are economically efficient in all situations. In this study, we develop a model of the relationship between software structure and software enhancement costs and errors. We introduce the notion of software structure as a moderator of the relationship between software volatility, total data complexity, and software enhancement outcomes. We posit that it is efficient to more highly structure the more volatile applications, because increased familiarity with the application structure through frequent enhancement enables localization of maintenance effort. For more complex applications, software structure is more beneficial than for less complex applications because it facilitates the comprehension process where it is most needed. Given the downstream enhancement benefits of structure for more volatile and complex applications, we expect that the optimal level of structure is higher for these applications. We empirically evaluate our model using data collected on the business applications of a major mass merchandiser and a large commercial bank. We find that structure moderates the relationship between complexity, volatility, and enhancement outcomes, such that higher levels of structure are more advantageous for the more complex and more volatile applications in terms of reduced enhancement costs and errors. We also find that more structure is designed in for volatile applications and for applications with higher levels of complexity. Finally, we identify application type as a significant factor in predicting which applications are more volatile and more complex at our research sites. That is, applications with induction-based algorithms such as those that support planning, forecasting, and management decision-making activities are more complex and more volatile than applications with rule-based algorithms that support operational and transaction-processing activities. Our results indicate that high investment in software quality practices such as structured design is not economically efficient in all situations. Our findings also suggest the importance of organizational mechanisms in promoting efficient design choices that lead to reduced enhancement costs and errors.},

In this paper, we formalize the interaction effect of IT by focusing on one core function, namely, research and development (R&D). We hypothesize that investments in IT can interact with and complement a firm's R&D investments, enhancing the firm's shareholder value creation potential. We test this by hypothesis by estimating the interaction impact of IT and R&D investments on Tobin's q, a forward-looking measure of firm performance using a recent multiyear, firm-level, archival data set. Our results suggest that the interaction effect of R&D and IT on Tobin's q is positive and significant after controlling for other firm- and industry-specific effects. Our findings provide rigorous empirical support for recent anecdotal evidence in the managerial literature with respect to the manner in which IT is enabling R&D-intensive innovation processes. Our analysis underscores the need for coordinated investments in IT and R&D, and permeating IT capabilities throughout other business processes such as R&D.},

Toward this end, we develop a novel, predictive analytics model, termed as the beta geometric Erlang-2 (BG/EG) hurdle model, which predicts the propensity, frequency, and timing of readmissions of patients diagnosed with congestive heart failure (CHF). This unified model enables us to answer three key questions related to the use of predictive analytics methods for patient readmissions: whether a readmission will occur, how often readmissions will occur, and when a readmission will occur. We test our model using a unique data set that tracks patient demographic, clinical, and administrative data across 67 hospitals in North Texas over a four-year period. We show that our model provides superior predictive performance compared to extant models such as the logit, BG/NBD hurdle, and EG hurdle models. Our model also allows us to study the association between hospital usage of health information technologies (IT) and readmission risk. We find that health IT usage, patient demographics, visit characteristics, payer type, and hospital characteristics, are significantly associated with patient readmission risk. We also observe that implementation of cardiology information systems is associated with a reduction in the propensity and frequency of future readmissions, whereas administrative IT systems are correlated with a lower frequency of future readmissions. Our results indicate that patient profiles derived from our model can serve as building blocks for a predictive analytics system to identify CHF patients with high readmission risk.},

We found that multiple kinds of value were produced and changed over time as different participants engaged with the OC and its evolving technology in various ways. To explain our findings, we theorize OC value as performed through the ongoing sociomaterial configuring of strategies, digital platforms, and stakeholder engagement. We develop a process perspective to explain these dynamics and identify multiple different kinds of value being created by an OC over time: financial, epistemic, ethical, service, reputational, and platform. Our research points to the importance of expanding the notion of OC users to encompass a broader understanding of stakeholders. It further suggests that creating OC value increasingly requires going beyond a dyadic relationship between the OC and the firm to encompassing a more complex relationship involving a wider ecosystem of stakeholders.},

The IT impacts on a given SBU are measured relative to a group of SBUs in the industry. The methodology involves a two-stage analysis of intermediate and higher level output variables that also accounts for industry and economy wide exogenous variables for tracing and measuring IT contributions. The data for testing the proposed model were obtained from SBUs in the manufacturing sector. Our results show significant positive impacts of IT at the intermediate level. The theoretical contribution of the study is a methodology that attempts to circumvent some of the measurement problems in this domain. It also provides a practical management tool to address the question of why (or why not) certain IT impacts occur. Additionally, through its process orientation, the suggested approach highlights key variables that may require managerial attention and subsequent action.},

Thus, an important research issue involves strategies for facilitating EDI adoption. We analyze the introduction of an EDI system in a vertical market involving one manufacturer and two suppliers. The manufacturer initiates an EDI network, and penalizes a supplier for not joining the system by reducing its volume of business with the supplier. Along with a “stick,” the manufacturer can also use a “carrot” in the form of a subsidy to partially offset a supplier's setup cost. The competition between the suppliers is characterized by incentive types for joining the EDI system (“motivating” or “threatening”) and the Information Technology (IT) efficiency (“efficient” or “inefficient”). We show that regardless of its cost structure, a supplier may have to join the EDI network out of “strategic necessity,” due to the presence of an IT-efficient supplier. Our analysis further shows that depending on the supplier competition structure, the EDI system may prove to be a “beneficial” strategic necessity for a large supplier and an “unfortunate” strategic necessity for a small supplier. Another key result is that by increasing the severity of the penalty, both the manufacturer and the follower supplier can be worse off under certain conditions. The analysis of subsidy strategies reveals that unless leadership and followership positions are reversed due to a subsidy, subsidizing a supplier has no impact on the joining time of its competitor. Thus the EDI initiator cannot induce both suppliers to join earlier by subsidizing one supplier. Also, the larger the slack capacity of the leader, the higher (lower) the manufacturer's incentive to subsidize the leader (follower). These results offer insights for initiators and adopters regarding penalty and subsidy strategies, impact on competition structure, joining decisions and network growth.},

However, some studies in strategy and information systems have suggested that long-term abnormal returns may be a more appropriate measure of the value of IT events. To reconcile these streams of research, we develop and test an exploratory framework involving the maturity and scope of an IT event to assess the suitability of short-versus long-term abnormal returns. We conceptualize event maturity in terms of diffusion of the technology or phenomenon, and scope as the extent of complementary organizational changes that need to be implemented and managed. We posit that because of lack of widespread knowledge of best practices and cases of success and failure in a period of low technological maturity, the market may find it difficult to price such an event completely during the announcement period. Similarly, the challenge of acquiring and interpreting information on a firm’s capability to manage wide scope of change may be an impediment to pricing high-scope events. We test our framework using a sample of 642 large outsourcing contracts and 1,700 electronic commerce initiatives. We empirically demonstrate that announcement period returns are indeed a complete measure of event value for cases characterized by high maturity and low scope; however, long-term abnormal returns are realized for events involving low maturity and/or high scope, which questions the validity of announcement period returns. Our results are robust to alternate model specifications. We conclude with a discussion of the implications for theory and practice, and directions for future research.

This paper explores the concept of IT competence of business managers as a contributor to their intention to champion IT within their organizations. Based on the knowledge literature, IT competence is defined as “ the set of IT-related knowledge and experience that a business manager possesses.” The relationship between IT knowledge, IT experience, and championing IT is tested empirically using Structural Equation Modeling with LISREL. Four hundred and four business managers from two large insurance organizations were surveyed. Specific areas of IT knowledge and IT experience were first identified and the first half of the data set was utilized to assess the measurement properties of the instrument in a confirmatory analysis. The contribution of IT knowledge and IT experience to their intention to champion IT was assessed using the second half of the data set. The results show that IT knowledge and IT experience together explain 34% of the variance in managers' intentions to champion IT. Recommendations are given as to how organizations can enhance their business managers IT knowledge and experience to achieve stronger IT leadership from line people.},

Their success, however, depends on participants' willingness to invest their time and attention in the absence of formal role and control structures. Why, then, would individuals choose to return repeatedly to a particular community and engage in the various behaviors that are necessary to keep conversation within the community going? Some studies of online communities argue that individuals are driven by self-interest, while others emphasize more altruistic motivations. To get beyond these inconsistent explanations, we offer a model that brings dissimilar rationales into a single conceptual framework and shows the validity of each rationale in explaining different online behaviors. Drawing on typologies of organizational commitment, we argue that members may have psychological bonds to a particular online community based on (a) need, (b) affect, and/or (c) obligation. We develop hypotheses that explain how each form of commitment to a community affects the likelihood that a member will engage in particular behaviors (reading threads, posting replies, moderating the discussion). Our results indicate that each form of community commitment has a unique impact on each behavior, with need-based commitment predicting thread reading, affect-based commitment predicting reply posting and moderating behaviors, and obligation-based commitment predicting only moderating behavior. Researchers seeking to understand how discussion-based communities function will benefit from this more precise theorizing of how each form of member commitment relates to different kinds of online behaviors. Community managers who seek to encourage particular behaviors may use our results to target the underlying form of commitment most likely to encourage the activities they wish to promote.},

On this basis, we identify an integrated system of well-established norms that regulate the use of IP within this community. We analyze the system’s characteristics and functioning, and we find that the “legal certainty” it provides is conducive to cooperation, cumulative effects, and innovation. We generalize our findings from the case by developing propositions aimed to spark further research. These propositions focus on similarities and differences between norms-based IP systems in online and off-line settings, and the conditions that determine the existence of norms-based IP systems as well as their form and effectiveness in online communities. In this way, we contribute to the literatures on norms-based IP systems and online communities and offer advice for the management of crowdsourcing communities.},

Using deconstruction, we analyze and interpret a systems development methodology currently receiving considerable attention—Information Engineering. We find that this methodology's characterization of IS-user relations and, in particular, its recommended partitioning of responsibility between IS and users is inconsistent and contradictory. Despite a heavy emphasis on user involvement, users are given a relatively passive role to play during development. At the same time, users are expected to sign off on projects and take responsibility for project outcomes. We suggest that such prescriptions, when put into action during systems development, make the relationship between users and IS personnel problematic. Further, we argue that the contradictions we surface in the methodology reflect contradictions and ideologies in the context within which systems development occurs. Our analysis raises important questions about the relationship between the production and consumption of information technology in organizations.},

This research investigated three variables believed to impact outcomes in telecommuting: the availability of information system technology, the availability of communication technologies, and the communication patterns of telecommuters within their work groups. Two perspectives are used in this study. The direct effects of these three variables on perceived productivity, performance, and satisfaction were tested. A second perspective, based on the concept of fit and contingency theory, posits that successful telecommuting outcomes, measured by perceived productivity, performance, and satisfaction, are predicted by interactions between these independent variables. The study was conducted by surveying multiple respondents from different organizations who were members of work groups in which some or all employees were telecommuters. The results indicate that technology variables positively impact productivity, performance, and satisfaction of telecommuters, while the interaction between the technology variables is significant in predicting perceived productivity. Work group communication, as measured by the centrality of individuals, negatively affects perceived productivity and performance. The paper presents a discussion of the theoretical significance of these findings, and offers recommendations for future research.},

   abstract                      = {In the digital era, it is increasingly important to understand how privacy decisions are made because information is frequently perceived as a commodity that is mismanaged. The preponderance of privacy literature focuses on individual-level information privacy concern and personal self-disclosure decisions. We propose that a more versatile multilevel description is required to enable exploration of complex privacy decisions that involve co-owned (i.e., group) information in increasingly sophisticated digital environments. We define the concepts of group and individual information privacy, “we-privacy” and “I-privacy” respectively, as the ability of an individual or group to construct, regulate, and apply the rules for managing their information and interaction with others. We develop the theory of multilevel information privacy (TMIP), which uses the theory of communication privacy management and the developmental theory of privacy as foundations for a social rule-based (i.e., normative) process of making privacy decisions that evolve over time with experience. The TMIP contributes to the privacy literature by drawing from prominent social psychology theories of group behavior (i.e., social identity and self-categorization theories) to explain how privacy decisions can be made by individuals or groups (i.e., social units) or social units acting as members of a particular group. We contend that technology complicates the privacy decision-making process by adding unique environmental characteristics that can influence the social identity assumed for a particular privacy decision, the estimation of the cost-benefit components of the privacy calculus, and the application and evolution of the norms that define the rules for information and interaction management. We discuss the implications of the TMIP for information systems research and provide a research agenda.},

These situations of asymmetric online piracy distort the competition between products. Using the French antipiracy law known as HADOPI (Haute Autorité pour la diffusion des œuvres et la protection des droits d'auteur sur internet) as a natural experiment, we study the asymmetric effects of online piracy on cinema admissions. Applying four estimation strategies at different levels of observation (town, movie, country, and consumer), we find that introduction of the law is associated with a 9% increase in the market share of American movies but that this increase occurs at the expense of other movies. These findings primarily originate from a high initial level of asymmetric piracy between American and other movies. This asymmetry was attenuated by the antipiracy law, resulting in a fiercer competition between movies and, as a side effect, in a decrease in the legal consumption of less-pirated products. These results have important implications for firms whose profits may be affected by legislation fighting piracy as well as for governments for the design of their policy.},

Classic real options models fail to account for the value of proactive uncertainty-reducing mitigations, since they assume that uncertainty is fixed or follows a continuous, time-dependent dynamics. We present adaptations of these models that address this shortcoming. In our models, zero or more mitigations can be applied in varying sequences, mitigations have impulse-type effects on uncertainty reduction, and mitigations’ effects can be complementary, substitutive, or synergetic. These traits make the value of mitigations path dependent and conditional on the uncertainty-reduction ability of earlier deployed mitigations. We operationalize the effects of mitigations in the IT and cybersecurity investment contexts. We also apply the adapted models to a real-world cybersecurity investment case from a Japanese company. Investments in multiple cybersecurity mitigations are typically treated as having a multiplicative effect that leads to overinvestment in mitigations. Our models avoid this problem, permitting to lower cybersecurity costs without compromising on loss prevention. More generally, our models allow implementing the real options logic more fully by supporting both passive and proactive IT investment risk management.

Prior research, for example, has made the case that pricing “real options” in real world operational and strategic settings offers the potential for useful insights in the evaluation of irreversible investments under uncertainty. However, most authors in the IS literature have made their cases using illustrative, rather than actual real world examples, and have always concluded with caveats and questions for future research about the applicability of such methods in practice. This paper makes three important contributions in this context: (1) it provides a formal theoretical grounding for the validity of the Black-Scholes option pricing model in the context of the spectrum of capital budgeting methods that might be employed to assess IT investments; (2) it shows why the assumptions of both the Black-Scholes and the binomial option pricing models place constraints on the range of IT investment situations that one can evaluate that are similar to those implied by traditional capital budgeting methods such as discounted cash flow analysis; and (3) it presents the first application of the Black-Scholes model that uses a real world business situation involving IT as its test bed. Our application focuses on an analysis of the timing of the deployment of point-of-sale (POS) debit services by the Yankee 24 shared electronic banking network of New England. This application enables us to make the case for the generalizability of the approach we discuss to four IT investment settings.},

History has played a major part in encouraging IS researchers to use diversity as a means of countering criticisms of their discipline and increasing their research rigor and productivity. In particular, frequent recourse to reference disciplines has underpinned much of the research that has been undertaken since the early 1980s. There are now signs, however, that the level of diversity that currently exists in IS research may be problematic. In this paper, we consider some of the benefits and costs of allowing diversity to reign in the IS discipline.

Drawing upon the transaction costs economics, organization theory and information systems literatures, we hypothese three sets of key influences: (1) factors exogenous to the relationship, i.e., the characteristics of the environment within which the relationship operates, and factors endogeneous to the relationship including (2) economic and behavioral characteristics of the relationship, and (3) interorganizational information technology applications. These factors have been independently examined in separate research streams. A key contribution of this study is therefore to conceptually and empirically capture their collective influence on cooperation. We empirically test the five hypotheses we develop within the context of buyer-supplier relationships in the U.S. and Japanese automobile industries. Multiple regressions conducted on a data set of 447 distinct relationships indicate that the relational characteristics (i.e., the behavioral climate of the relationship) are the most robust predictor of cooperation in both countries when compared with other structural (e.g., asset specificity) or technological factors (use of EDI—electronic data interchange). Environmental uncertainty (i.e., technological unpredictability) is positively associated with cooperation in Japanese supplier relations, which suggests that cooperation can act as an uncertainty absorption mechanism. Governance structure is a strong and significant predictor of cooperation in both samples, but with the opposite sign. Similarly, information technology (IT) does not play the same predictive role in the two country samples. Significant only in Japan it reflects an ‘electronic partnership’ approach to the use of IT in supplier relations.},

Past research on constructing conceptual models has generally focused on their semantics (their meaning), to discover how to convey meaning more clearly and completely, or their pragmatics (the importance of context in model creation and use), to discover how best to create or use a model in a given situation. We join these literatures by showing how semantics and pragmatics interact. Specifically, we carried out an experiment to examine how the importance of clear semantics in conceptual models—operationalized in terms of ontological clarity—varies depending on the pragmatics of readers' knowledge of the domain shown in the model. Our results show that the benefit of ontological clarity on understanding is concave downward (follows an inverted-U) as a function of readers' prior domain knowledge. The benefit is greatest when readers have moderate knowledge of the domain shown in the model. When readers have high or low domain knowledge, ontological clarity has no apparent benefit. Our study extends the theory of ontological clarity and emphasizes the need to construct conceptual models with readers' knowledge in mind.},

The enterprise system is introduced in accordance with the logic of managerial rationalism, but some of the institutional logics that organizational actors draw upon and reproduce contradict the logic of managerial rationalism in certain situations. In these situations, organizational actors loosely couple elements of their practices from the practices implied by the enterprise system, thus satisfying the demands associated with both institutional fields. We identify four generalizable forms of loose coupling that result from these institutional contradictions: temporal, material, procedural, and interpretive, and discuss their effects on both the system implementation and local practices. Further, we show how, through the use of institutional logics, researchers can identify fundamental institutional contradictions that explain regularities in the situated responses to enterprise system implementations—regularities that are consistently identified in the literature across a variety of organizational contexts.},

Our framework includes a conceptualization of the relationship among replication, extension, and generation in IS research. The concept of “research space” is defined and a framework is developed that delineates eight possible research strategies.

Research from cognitive psychology has shown that it is possible to manipulate nonconscious cognition and behavior through “priming,” a well-known phenomenon in which words and images are used to activate desired concepts in participants’ minds. Our goal in this was to investigate whether priming during the task execution (called contextual priming) using 3D objects in the VE can improve brainstorming performance. To investigate this, we conducted two studies. The first used priming objects specifically related to the task topic and the second used priming objects related to creativity, in general. Compared to VEs without 3D priming objects, our results show that when groups brainstormed in the VEs designed with 3D priming objects, they generated better quality ideas as well as a greater breadth and depth of ideas. Thus, the 3D priming stimuli incorporated in a VE enhances brainstorming, which indicates that the design of VE has a direct effect on team brainstorming performance. Our results also show that target concept activation and task absorption act as the underlying mechanisms, partially mediating the relationship between the design of the VE (i.e., the presence or absence of priming objects) and performance outcomes.},

Consistent with the complementarity perspective, we view this specific form of IS capability as enhancing manufacturing's coordination with marketing and supply chain functions to drive manufacturing performance. Additionally, the theoretical model presented here introduces manufacturing-IS coordination, a form of coordination not considered in past research, as a key antecedent to integrated IS capability. The research thus provides a comprehensive framework for examining manufacturing performance in contexts that have been transformed by the use of advanced information systems. The theoretical model is tested using primary data collected from manufacturing firms and matched with objective manufacturing performance data from secondary sources. Results show that a firm's integrated IS capability, as well as the complementary effects of IS capability with manufacturing, marketing, and supply chain processes, are significant predictors of manufacturing performance. These findings are robust to concerns of endogeneity, unobserved heterogeneity, and alternative model specification.},

Infomediaries offer matching services that facilitate establishment of a buyer-seller agreement, and value-added services that either provide a standalone benefit or enhance benefits from matching services. This paper develops and analyzes economic models of intermediaries to examine their pricing and product line design strategies. Intermediaries provide aggregation benefits: Buyers find an intermediary’s service more valuable if it provides access to more sellers, and sellers value it more if it provides access to more buyers, but also when they compete with fewer sellers. Due to this unique combination of network effects, we find that an intermediary has stronger incentives to provide quality-differentiated versions of its service relative to other information goods sellers. When buyers have constant marginal valuations for service quality, the intermediary should offer only two levels of service. While it is optimal for the intermediary to offer two levels of service, increasing the quality of the low-level service reduces the intermediary’s profits due to increased cannibalization of the premium service. Hence, the optimal menu consists of a basic matching service and a premium service that includes matching and value-added services. The intermediary’s profits are larger when positive network effects are stronger, and lower when negative network effects are stronger.},

The durations of these visits vary not only across consumers but also for a given consumer across multiple visits. We argue that the amount of time that a consumer spends on the first visit to a website depends on how she is drawn to the website. We find that the duration of the first visit is influenced by the advertising tool—banner ad or search engine—used to attract consumers to the website. The durations of subsequent visits are influenced by the durations of earlier visits. The search durations are also influenced by the visit day of the week and time of day. In this paper, we develop a multiple-spell competing risk model to capture the underlying stochastic process, chief elements of which are two interrelated processes: a duration process and a transition process. The multistate, multiple-spell model allows us to identify a window of opportunity, within which the purchase probability is higher than the exit probability. Online salespersons should target site visitors during this window of opportunity. The model, which is calibrated on clickstream data obtained from a major online vendor, can also be used to determine the bid price strategy for search engine ads.},

The customer support center's costly efforts at joint product improvement include transcribing and analyzing customer feedback, analyzing market trends, and investing in product design. Yet this cooperative role must be adequately incentivized by the client, since it could lead to fewer service requests and hence lower revenues for the customer support center. We model this problem as a sequential game with double-sided moral hazard in a principal-agent framework (in which the client is the principal). We follow the contracting literature in modeling the effort of the customer support center, which is the first mover, as either unobservable or observable; in either case, the efforts are unverifiable and so cannot be contracted on directly. We show that it is optimal for the client to offer the customer support center a linear gain-share contract when efforts are unobservable, even though it can yield only the second-best solution for the client. We also show that the cost-plus contracts widely used in practice do not obtain the optimal solution. However, we demonstrate that if efforts are observable then a gain-share and cost-plus options- based contract is optimal and will also yield the first-best solution. Our research provides a systematic theoretical framework that accounts for the prevalence of gain-share contracts in the IT industry's joint improvement efforts, and it provides guiding principles for understanding the increased role for customer support centers in product improvement.},

   abstract                      = {With the rapid growth of online social network sites (SNSs), it has become imperative for platform owners and online marketers to quantify what factors drive content production on these platforms. Previous research identified challenges in modeling these factors statistically using observational data, where the key difficulty is the inability of conventional methods to disentangle the effects of network formation and network influence on content generation from the subsequent feedback effect of newly generated content on network structure. In this paper, we adopt and enhance an actor-oriented continuous-time statistical model that enables the joint estimation of the coevolution of the users’ social network structure and of the amount of content they produce, using a Markov chain Monte Carlo–based simulation approach. Specifically, we offer a method to analyze nonstationary and continuous-time behavioral data, typically recorded in social media ecosystems, in the presence of network effects and other observable and unobservable user-specific covariates. The proposed method can help disentangle network effects of interest from feedback effects on the network. We apply our model to social network and public posting data over six months to find that (1) users tend to connect with others that have similar posting behavior; (2) however, after doing so, these users tend to diverge in their posting behavior, and (3) peer influence effects are sensitive to the strength of the posting behavior. More broadly, the proposed method provides researchers and practitioners with a statistically rigorous approach to analyze network effects in observational data. Our results lead to insights and recommendations for SNS platform owners on how to sustain an active and viable community.

This paper is the first to analyze the effect of different pricing rules on the efficiency of combinatorial exchanges, using both analytic methods and numerical experiments. Our analysis is motivated by a combinatorial fishery-rights exchange designed to reform the fishing industry in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. We find that when linearity and anonymity are required for only one side of the market, the average efficiency loss is negligible. In contrast, with a single linear price vector for both sides, the efficiency loss is substantial, especially when the market is small. In a formal model, we show that efficiency losses decrease when the number of buyers grows or the size of the submitted packages decreases. Besides the reform of the NSW fishing industry, our results have important implications for other cap-and-trade programs as well as other industries where demand or cost complementarities play a role.},

Established mechanisms are either efficient or envy free, and the efficiency loss in envy-free mechanisms is substantial. We focus on a widespread representative of a matching problem: course assignment where students have preferences for courses and organizers have priorities over students. An important feature in course assignment is that a course has a maximum capacity and a minimum required quota. This is also a requirement in many other matching applications, such as school choice, hospital-residents matching, or the assignment of workers to jobs. We introduce RESPCT, a mechanism that respects minimum quotas and is truthful, efficient, and has low levels of envy. The reduction in envy is significant and is due to two remarkably effective heuristics. We provide analytical and experimental results based on field data from a large-scale course assignment application. These results have led to a policy change and the proposed assignment system is now being used to match hundreds of students every semester.},

The coordination problem manifests itself by the fact that losing bidders need to submit nonoverlapping package bids that are high enough to outbid the standing winners. We propose an auction format, which leverages the information that the auctioneer collects throughout the auction about the preferences of individual bidders and suggests prices for the members of losing bidder coalitions, which in total would make a given coalition winning. We model the bidder’s bundle selection problem as a coordination game, which provides a theoretical rationale for bidders to agree to these prices, and highlights the role of the auctioneer in providing relevant information feedback. Results of extensive numerical simulations and experiments with human participants demonstrate that this type of pricing substantially reduces the number of auction rounds and bids necessary to find a competitive equilibrium, and at the same time significantly increases auction efficiency in the lab. This rapid convergence is crucial for the practical viability of combinatorial auctions in larger markets. The online appendix is available at https://doi.org/10.1287/isre.2016.0681 .},

   abstract                      = {Iterative combinatorial auctions (ICAs) are IT-based economic mechanisms where bidders submit bundle bids in a sequence and an auctioneer computes allocations and ask prices in each auction round. The literature in this field provides equilibrium analysis for ICAs with nonlinear personalized prices under strong assumptions on bidders' strategies. Linear pricing has performed very well in the lab and in the field. In this paper, we compare three selected linear price ICA formats based on allocative efficiency and revenue distribution using different bidding strategies and bidder valuations. The goal of this research is to benchmark different ICA formats and design and analyze new auction rules for auctions with pseudodual linear prices. The multi-item and discrete nature of linear price iterative combinatorial auctions and the complex price calculation schemes defy much of the traditional game theoretical analysis in this field. Computational methods can be of great help in exploring potential auction designs and analyzing the virtues of various design options. In our simulations, we found that ICA designs with linear prices performed very well for different valuation models even in cases of high synergies among the valuations. There were, however, significant differences in efficiency and in the revenue distributions of the three ICA formats. Heuristic bidding strategies using only a few of the best bundles also led to high levels of efficiency. We have also identified a number of auction rules for ask price calculation and auction termination that have shown to perform very well in the simulations.},

   abstract                      = {Combinatorial auctions have been suggested as a means to raise efficiency in multi-item negotiations with complementarities among goods because they can be applied in procurement, energy markets, transportation, and the sale of spectrum auctions. The combinatorial clock (CC) auction has become very popular in these markets for its simplicity and for its highly usable price discovery, derived by the use of linear prices. Unfortunately, no equilibrium bidding strategies are known. Given the importance of the CC auction in the field, it is highly desirable to understand whether there are efficient versions of the CC auction providing a strong game theoretical solution concept. So far, equilibrium strategies have only been found for combinatorial auctions with nonlinear and personalized prices for very restricted sets of bidder valuations. We introduce an extension of the CC auction, the CC+ auction, and show that it actually leads to efficient outcomes in an ex post equilibrium for general valuations with only linear ask prices. We also provide a theoretical analysis on the worst case efficiency of the CC auction, which highlights situations in which the CC leads to highly inefficient outcomes. As in other theoretical models of combinatorial auctions, bidders in the field might not be able to follow the equilibrium strategies suggested by the game-theoretical predictions. Therefore, we complement the theoretical findings with results from computational and laboratory experiments using realistic value models. The experimental results illustrate that the CC+ auction can have a significant impact on efficiency compared to the CC auction.},

These novel sociotechnical arrangements afford finely-grained manipulation of how tasks can be represented and have changed the way organizations ideate. In this paper, we investigate differences in behavioral decision-making resulting from IT-based support of open idea evaluation. We report results from a randomized experiment of 120 participants comparing IT-based decision-making support using a rating scale (representing a judgment task) and a preference market (representing a choice task). We find that the rating scale-based task invokes significantly higher perceived ease of use than the preference market-based task and that perceived ease of use mediates the effect of the task representation treatment on the users’ decision quality. Furthermore, we find that the understandability of ideas being evaluated, which we assess through the ideas’ readability, and the perception of the task’s variability moderate the strength of this mediation effect, which becomes stronger with increasing perceived task variability and decreasing understandability of the ideas. We contribute to the literature by explaining how perceptual differences of task representations for open idea evaluation affect the decision quality of users and translate into differences in mechanism accuracy. These results enhance our understanding of how crowdsourcing as a novel mode of value creation may effectively complement traditional work structures.},

In the entity-relationship model, for example, the fact that a thing may not possess an attribute can be represented by using a special symbol to indicate that the attribute is optional. Similarly, the fact that a thing may or may not be involved in a relationship can be represented by showing the minimum cardinality of the relationship as zero. Whether these practices should be followed, however, is a contentious issue. An alternative approach is to eliminate optional attributes and relationships from conceptual schema diagrams by using subtypes that have only mandatory attributes and relationships. In this paper, we first present a theory that led us to predict that optional attributes and relationships should be used in conceptual schema diagrams only when users of the diagrams require a surface-level understanding of the domain being represented by the diagrams. When users require a deep-level understanding, however, optional attributes and relationships should not be used because they undermine users' abilities to grasp important domain semantics. We describe three experiments which we then undertook to test our predictions. The results of the experiments support our predictions.},

As a solution to providing awareness, we integrate the framework of organizational memory with intelligent agent technology to provide a coordination mechanism that enables the structuring of awareness events and gives information about the users' feedback control. In the proposed model, feedback control relationships are captured into a multilayered model of organizational memory and transferred to users by agents-facilitators.

In addition to the direct benefits of auditing, data collected in this study through interviews, a focus group, and surveys of medical practitioners and audit experts indicate that auditing has a second-order effect through which audit information diffuses in the practitioner network triggering deterrence. This second-order effect, referred to as the “sentinel effect,” has been overlooked by auditing algorithms that have traditionally focused on detection of fraudulent claims or practitioners only. The authors present an algorithm that supports a deterrence-driven audit approach in the presence of audit and sentinel effects. Simulation results, augmented with real practitioner data from two counties in Florida, indicate the potential of such algorithms at reducing excess costs, especially when waste and abuse are prevalent. Management insight: Savings from audit arise as a result of both the direct audit effect and the sentinel effect, which causes deterrence among people who might hear about audits. Insurance providers could therefore consider connectedness, conditional on high enough risk scores, when selecting practitioners for audit. Through the sentinel effect, large numbers of practitioners receiving the audit information are likely to improve billing behavior, ultimately maximizing deterrence from waste and abuse and reducing overall healthcare costs.},

An initial experiment using logical data models indicated that more expressive logical data models also enhanced end-user performance for information retrieval tasks. However, the principles of parsimony and bounded rationality imply that, past some point, increases in size lead to a level of complexity that results in impaired performance. The results of this study support these principles. For a logical data model of increased but still modest size, users composing queries for the more expressive logical data model did not perform as well as users composing queries for the corresponding less expressive but more parsimonious logical data model. These results indicate that, when constructing logical data models, data modelers should consider tradeoffs between parsimony and expressiveness.},

One step toward providing sound management guidelines is to improve understanding of the social forces which affect the introduction and diffusion process within organizations. This research takes a step toward that goal by examining the validity of innovation diffusion theory within the context of end-user computing. The research involved a field study and historical analysis of the diffusion of spreadsheet software in organizations. To assist in controlling exogenous factors, only finance and accounting departments were studied. Over 500 professionals in 24 business units from 18 large businesses in manufacturing and services participated in the research. Findings supported hypotheses that earlier adopters of spreadsheet software were younger, more highly educated, more attuned to mass media, more involved in interpersonal communication, and more likely to be opinion leaders. Also supported was the hypothesized sigmoidal distribution of adoption over time. Application of the theory was not supported in all areas, however, suggesting that information technology diffusion is different from other diffusion phenomena. Contrary to theory, interpersonal channels of communication were dominant in all phases of adoption decision making. And contrary to their hypothesized role as change agent, IS departments played a minor role in the diffusion process. This was consistent with the observed user-led nature of the phenomenon. Implications for research and practice are discussed.},

   abstract                      = {Crowd-funded markets have recently emerged as a novel source of capital for entrepreneurs. As the economic potential of these markets is now being realized, they are beginning to go mainstream, a trend reflected by the explicit attention crowdfunding has received in the American Jobs Act as a potential avenue for economic growth, as well as the recent focus that regulators such as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission have placed upon it. Although the formulation of regulation and policy surrounding crowd-funded markets is becoming increasingly important, the behavior of crowdfunders, an important aspect that must be considered in this formulation effort, is not yet well understood. A key factor that can influence the behavior of crowd funders is information on prior contribution behavior, including the amount and timing of others' contributions, which is published for general consumption. With that in mind, in this study, we empirically examine social influence in a crowd-funded marketplace for online journalism projects, employing a unique data set that incorporates contribution events and Web traffic statistics for approximately 100 story pitches. This data set allows us to examine both the antecedents and consequences of the contribution process. First, noting that digital journalism is a form of public good, we evaluate the applicability of two competing classes of economic models that explain private contribution toward public goods in the presence of social information: substitution models and reinforcement models. We also propose a new measure that captures both the amount and the timing of others' contribution behavior: contribution frequency (dollars per unit time). We find evidence in support of a substitution model, which suggests a partial crowding-out effect, where contributors may experience a decrease in their marginal utility from making a contribution as it becomes less important to the recipient. Further, we find that the duration of funding and, more importantly, the degree of exposure that a pitch receives over the course of the funding process, are positively associated with readership upon the story's publication. This appears to validate the widely held belief that a key benefit of the crowdfunding model is the potential it offers for awareness and attention-building around causes and ventures. This last aspect is a major contribution of the study, as it demonstrates a clear linkage between marketing effort and the success of crowd-funded projects.},

Many online platforms account for this by providing users with granular control over when and how their identity or actions are made visible to peers. However, little work has sought to understand the effect that a user’s decision to conceal information might have on observing peers, who are likely to refer to that information when deciding on their own actions. We leverage a unique impression-level data set from one of the world’s largest online crowdfunding platforms, where contributors are given the option to conceal their username or contribution amount from public display, with each transaction. We demonstrate that when campaign contributors elect to conceal information, it has a negative influence on subsequent visitors’ likelihood of conversion, as well as on their average contributions, conditional on conversion. Moreover, we argue that social norms are an important driver of information concealment, providing evidence of peer influence in the decision to conceal. We discuss the implications of our results for the provision of online information hiding mechanisms, as well as the design of crowdfunding platforms and electronic markets more generally.},

The second assumption we challenge is that existing measurement practices are unproblematic, even if researchers sometimes vary in how well they enact them. We explain why current norms (both espoused and enacted) are deficient in some important ways because they fail to emphasize the fundamental issues of measures and measurements. Drawing on symbolic logic, we provide a framework to help positivist researchers to assess efforts in measuring and measurement regardless of their quantitative or qualitative orientation. The framework provides more parsimonious and broadly applicable guidance than available to date and suggests the need to refocus on measurement fundamentals.

One of the most important, yet elusive roles of conceptual models is to increase analysts’ understanding of a domain. In this paper, we evaluate the ability of the good decomposition model (GDM) (Wand and Weber 1990) to explain the degree to which conceptual models communicate meaning about a domain to analysts. We address the question, “Do unified modeling language (UML) analysis diagrams that manifest better decompositions increase analysts’ understanding of a domain?” GDM defines five conditions (minimality, determinism, losslessness, weak coupling, and strong cohesion) deemed necessary to decompose a domain in such a way that the resulting model communicates meaning about the domain effectively. In our evaluation, we operationalized each of these conditions in a set of UML diagrams and tested participants’ understanding of those diagrams. Our results lend support to GDM across measures of actual understanding. However, the impact on participants’ perceptions of their understanding was equivocal.},

In this article, we present a systematic approach for reconceptualizing the system usage construct in particular nomological contexts. Comprising two stages, definition and selection, the approach enables researchers to develop clear and valid measures of system usage for a given theoretical and substantive context. The definition stage requires that researchers define system usage and explicate its underlying assumptions. In the selection stage, we suggest that system usage be conceptualized in terms of its structure and function. The structure of system usage is tripartite, comprising a user, system, and task, and researchers need to justify which elements of usage are most relevant for their study. In terms of function, researchers should choose measures for each element (i.e., user, system, and/or task) that tie closely to the other constructs in the researcher's nomological network. To provide evidence of the viability of the approach, we undertook an empirical investigation of the relationship between system usage and short-run task performance in cognitively engaging tasks. The results support the benefits of the approach and show how an inappropriate choice of usage measures can lead researchers to draw opposite conclusions in an empirical study. Together, the approach and the results of the empirical investigation suggest new directions for research into the nature of system usage, its antecedents, and its consequences.},

Organizations are under great pressure to use information systems effectively but they have few theories to turn to for insights. Motivated by this need, we propose an approach for developing context-specific theories of effective use. The approach suggests that effective use can be theorized by: (1) understanding how a network of affordances supports the achievement of organizational goals, (2) understanding how the affordances are actualized, and (3) using inductive theorizing to elaborate these principles in a given context. We demonstrate the approach in the context of a Canadian health authority’s use of a community-care electronic healthcare record (EHR). We discovered that effective use in this context can be viewed at a high level as the accuracy and consistency with which users work with the EHR, and how they engage in reflection-in-action across a network of nine affordances. The key, however, is understanding how those elements interact with the multiple levels of data needed to achieve the organization’s various goals. Overall, we contribute by offering an approach for developing context-specific theories of effective use, demonstrating its usefulness in an important context, and discovering the importance of understanding in a new way the multilevel nature of information systems.

   abstract                      = {As telecommunication networks become more common, there is an increasing interest in the factors underlying the development of online social structures. It has been proposed that these structures are new forms of organizing which are not subject to the same constraints as traditional social structures. However, from anecdotal evidence and case studies it is difficult to evaluate whether online social structures are subject to the same problems as traditional social structures. Drawing from prior studies of traditional social structures and empirical analyses of longitudinal data from a sample of Internet-based groups, this exploratory work considers the role of size and communication activity in sustainable online social structures. A resource-based theory of sustainable social structures is presented. Members contribute time, energy, and other resources, enabling a social structure to provide benefits for individuals. These benefits, which include information, influence, and social support, are the basis for a social structure's ability to attract and retain members. This model focuses on the system of opposing forces that link membership size as a component of resource availability and communication activity as an aspect of benefit provision to the sustainability of an online social structure. Analyses of data from a random sample of e-mail-based Internet social structures (listservs) indicate that communication activity and size have both positive and negative effects on a structure's sustainability. These results suggest that while the use of networked communication technologies may alter the form of communication, balancing the opposing impacts of membership size and communication activity in order to maintain resource availability and provide benefits for current members remains a fundamental problem underlying the development of sustainable online social structures.},

Instead, digital entrepreneurs now pursue locations that provide more opportunities for funding (rounds) and greater social network support. Analyzing data for entrepreneurial ventures that were successful in receiving some external funding, we found that the number of funding rounds per year plays a significant and positive role in influencing start-up creation in that location—interestingly, amount of funding does not. Furthermore, local social network density creates stickiness to that location, thus negatively influencing entrepreneurs' willingness to relocate. If entrepreneurs do relocate to create a start-up after a short delay, larger social network density (in a new location) positively affects start-up creation decision in that location. Additionally, we find that midcareer individuals (such as millennials) are more likely than early-career or late-career stage individuals to create a successful technology start-up. Also, entrepreneurs are less likely to relocate for an Internet-based start-up but are likely to move if they have larger social network density in the new location. This research enhances our understanding of the factors that influence decisions to launch a start-up in a particular location and provides policy implications for creating a rich entrepreneurial ecosystem in a city.},

An important feature of an online discussion community is its content boundaries, which are individual perceptions of what materials and discussions are part of the community and what are not, and how that community is related to others within a larger system. Yet in spite of its importance, many community infrastructures allow individual participants to reshape content boundaries by simultaneously associating their contributions with multiple online discussion communities. This reshaping behavior is a controversial aspect of the creation and management of many types of online discussion communities. On one hand, many communities explicitly discourage boundary reshaping behaviors in their frequently asked questions or terms-of-use document. On the other hand, community infrastructures continue to allow such reshaping behaviors. To explain this controversy, we theorize how the extent of boundary reshaping in an online discussion community has simultaneously positive and negative effects on its member dynamics and responsiveness. We test predictions about the conflicting effects of reshaping behaviors with 60 months of longitudinal data from 140 USENET newsgroups, focusing on cross-posting activities as a form of reshaping behavior. Empirical results are consistent with the proposed hypotheses that reshaping behaviors within a discussion community affect member dynamics and community responsiveness in both positive and negative ways. Taken together, the findings highlight the boundary-related design challenges faced by managers seeking to support ongoing activity within online discussion communities.},

   abstract                      = {Dealing with spam is very costly, and many organizations have tried to reduce spam-related costs by installing spam filters. Relying on modern econometric methods to reduce the selection bias of installing a spam filter, we use a unique data setting implemented at a German university to measure the costs associated with spam and the costs savings of spam filters. Our methodological framework accounts for effect heterogeneity and can be easily used to estimate the effect of other IS technologies implemented in organizations. The majority of costs stem from the time that employees spend identifying and deleting spam, amounting to an average of approximately five minutes per employee per day. Our analysis, which accounts for selection bias, finds that the installation of a spam filter reduces these costs by roughly one third. Failing to account for the selection bias would lead to a result that suggests that installing a spam filter does not reduce working time losses. However, cost savings only occur when the spam burden is high, indicating that spam filters do not necessarily reduce costs and are therefore no universal remedy. The analysis further shows that spam filters alone are a countermeasure against spam that exhibits only limited effectiveness because they only reduce costs by one third.},

   abstract                      = {As a result of newer communication technologies and an increase in virtual communication, employees often find themselves multicommunicating, or participating in multiple conversations at the same time. This research seeks to explore multicommunicating from the perspective of the person juggling multiple conversations at the same time—the focal individual. To better understand this phenomenon, we extend previous theorizing by including the concepts of the episode initiator (whether the second conversation was focal or partner initiated), the fit of the set of media used in the episode, one process gain (conversation leveraging), and process losses. Employing a series of pilot studies and a main study, the resulting model was analyzed using structural equation modeling, finding overall support for the model. Findings suggest that experienced intensity is an important factor influencing process losses experienced during multicommunicating, whereas episode initiator influences process losses and the process gain. Further, media fit moderates the relationship between intensity and process losses. The importance of multicommunicating in the workplace is discussed, the theoretical and practical contributions of this research are described, and limitations and suggestions for future research are outlined.},

By the mid-1800s, the census had evolved into an elaborate Victorian data-processing operation involving over a hundred clerks, each of whom had a specialized information-processing role. In 1911 the census was mechanized and the routine data processing was taken over by punched-card machines. This paper explores the changes in information technology within the census over a period of more than a century, and the resulting organizational changes. A contrast is drawn with the U.S. census—which mechanized in 1890—on the adoption of new technology.},

The results support the eCAM as a new theoretical lens for understanding electronic commerce-based attraction. Comparisons are made between the proposed eCAM and previously established adoption models (i.e., the Technology Acceptance Model and WebQual) as well as the discriminant validity of the constructs in these models. Results demonstrate that the eCAM provides additional insights for understanding how website design influences e-commerce attraction and adoption. The implications of these results for future research and website design are discussed.},

We model peer disclosure as the imposition of a negative externality on other people. Our model encompasses the benefits of posting information, positive externalities in the form of recognition and entertainment benefits due to others’ sharing of information, and heterogeneous privacy preferences. We find that regulation of peer disclosure is necessary. We consider two candidate regulations, i.e., nudging and quotas. Nudging reduces user participation and privacy harm and sometimes improves social welfare. By contrast, imposing a quota often improves user participation, privacy protection, and social welfare. Adding a nudge on top of a quota does not bring additional benefits. We show that any regulation that uniformly controls the disclosure of sensitive and nonsensitive information will not serve the triple objectives of reducing privacy harm, increasing social welfare, and increasing information contribution. We derive a necessary condition for solutions that can fulfill these three objectives. We also compare the incentives of the platform owner and social planner and draw related managerial and policy implications.

This study posits the existence of additional beliefs that inhibit usage intentions and thus foster technology rejection rather than acceptance. We theorize that these inhibitors are more than just the antipoles of enablers (e.g., the opposite of usefulness or reliability) and so are distinct constructs worthy of their own investigation. Inhibitors are proposed to have effects on usage intentions beyond that of enablers as well as effects on enablers themselves. We report on a series of empirical studies designed to test the existence and effects of inhibitors. A candidate set of six inhibitors is shown to be distinct from enablers. These inhibitors are subsequently tested in a field study of 387 individuals nested within 32 different websites. Effects at both individual and website unit levels of analysis are tested using multilevel modeling. We find that inhibitors have negative effects on usage intentions, as well as on enablers, and these effects vary contingent upon individual or website unit levels of analysis. The overall results support the existence and importance of inhibitors in explaining individual intent to use—or not use—technology.},

   abstract                      = {Multihoming, the decision to design a complement to operate on multiple platforms, is becoming increasingly common in many platform markets. Perceived wisdom suggests that multihoming is beneficial for complement providers as they expand their market reach, but it reduces differentiation among competing platforms as the same complements become available on different platforms. We argue that complement providers face trade-offs when designing their products for multiple platform architectures—they must decide how far to specialize the complement to each platform’s technological specifications. Because of these trade-offs, multihoming complements can have different quality performance across platforms. In a study of the U.S. video game industry, we find that multihoming games have lower-quality performance on a technologically more complex console than on a less complex one. Also, games designed for and released on a focal platform have lower-quality performance on platforms they are subsequently multihomed to. However, games that are released on the complex platform with a delay suffer a smaller drop in quality on complex platforms. This has important implications for platform competition, and for managers considering expanding their reach through multihoming.

This research proposes two distinct roles to understand how information technology competencies shape organizational agility and firm performance. In their enabling role, IT competencies are expected to directly enhance entrepreneurial and adaptive organizational agility. In their facilitating role, IT competencies should enhance firm performance by helping the implementation of requisite entrepreneurial and adaptive actions. Furthermore, we argue that the effects of the dual roles of IT competencies are moderated by multiple contingencies arising from environmental dynamism and other sources. We test our model and hypotheses through a latent class regression analysis on data from a sample of 109 business-to-business electronic marketplaces. The results provide support for the enabling and facilitating roles of IT competencies. Moreover, we find that these dual effects vary according to environmental dynamism. The results suggest that managers should account for (multiple) contingencies (observed and unobserved) while assessing the effects of IT competencies on organizational agility and firm performance.},

We shed light on this issue by examining the impact that Craigslist (via its Erotic Service section) has on prostitution incidence using a data set consisting of 1,796 U.S. counties from 1999 to 2008. Our analysis shows that prostitution levels increased by about 17% on average upon the introduction of the Craigslist. We find that the Craigslist has led to the increase in both independent sex workers and workers operating under commercial vice groups. However, it is the latter that is growing at a greater rate, which bears important implications for policies concerning sex trafficking. Craigslist’s entry increases prostitution in both counties that have existing prostitution trends and those that do not, although the former set of counties experience a larger growth relative to the latter. Finally, we also found evidence suggesting that efforts in utilizing Craigslist for prostitution arrests are not catching up with the growth in prostitution trends induced by the site. In sum, online platforms can be utilized in unintended manners that facilitate illegal activities. Policy makers and website owners need to be aware of such impacts to implement the proper guidelines.},

In contrast, prior research has largely focused on the direct and contemporaneous impacts of IT investments. As a result, we do not fully understand how IT investments are associated with ongoing productivity improvements in future periods and how spillovers influence these gains. In this paper, we examine whether firms receive incremental benefits from IT-related spillovers and whether these spillovers lead to more persistent returns. We focus on the spillovers that accrue to firms from their interindustry transactions, especially the IT services industry. We model and estimate the impact of spillovers on long-run productivity using firm-level data from the manufacturing, transportation, trade, and services sectors. We find that spillover impacts are highly significant, but that the magnitude and persistence of the impacts vary. Firms with high IT intensity receive greater spillover benefits from the IT services industry. Moreover, these benefits are sustained over a long-term horizon. However, the impact of IT-related spillovers does not persist in low IT intensity firms regardless of the source. Overall, our results shed light on the existence and sources of IT-related spillovers and on their important role in shaping the long-run returns to IT investment. Our results also help explain the findings of excess returns to IT investment in the IT productivity literature.},

Because competition can be a driver of efficiency and industries display varying degrees of competitiveness, firm-level efficiency is likely to display considerable heterogeneity. To shed light on these questions, we analyze the economic impact of IT on technical efficiency, a key component of efficiency, in heterogeneous competitive settings. Our study employs a number of econometric techniques, including a stochastic frontier and a generalized method of moments approach, on data from firms in a wide cross-section of industries. We find, after controlling for firm-level heterogeneity and potential endogeneity, that IT is positively associated with gains in technical efficiency but its impact is moderated by the degree of competition. Firms display large variation in their levels of technical efficiency partly because of the heterogeneous market competitiveness conditions they face. In more competitive industries, firms tend to deploy IT more intensively and use it more efficiently. Our study makes a distinct contribution relative to prior studies that have focused on the productivity impacts of IT while assuming perfect competition and not allowing for potential heterogeneity in firm-level efficiency. Overall, our results demonstrate that IT and competition are significant determinants of gains in technical efficiency and provide insight into how competition affects the returns to IT investment.},

In particular, we focus on a context in which the combined search engine company competes with a market leader holding a larger share of the market than the two runner-up “underdogs” combined. Our results indicate that, with the presence of NI and cascading effects, an alliance with “only” 35%–40% combined market share could compete with a leader whose market share, at the time of an alliance, is 60%–65%. Although important, size alone might be insufficient to build the market as suggested by the “vanilla” network effect theory. Another noteworthy finding is that a nonlinear association exists between NI and an alliance outcome; the combined runner-up companies have the best chance of success when the extent of NI is midrange, rather than on the high or low end of continuum. Contrary to the conventional view, this finding might also stimulate discussions among network science researchers. Furthermore, our results suggest that NI substantially moderates the relationship between the combined market share at the time of an alliance and the likelihood of resulting alliance success.},

This paper develops a pricing model for digital experience goods in a segmented market and explores the optimality of sampling as a piracy-mitigating strategy. Consumers are aware of the true fit of an experience good to their tastes only after consumption, and as piracy offers an additional (albeit illegal) consumption opportunity, traditional segmentation findings from economics and sampling recommendations from marketing, need to be revisited. We develop a two-stage model of piracy for a market where consumers are heterogeneous in their marginal valuation for quality and their moral costs. In our model, some consumers pirate the product in the first stage allowing them to update their fit-perception that may result in re-evaluation of their buying/pirating decision in the second stage. We recommend distinct pricing and sampling strategies for underestimated and overestimated products and suggest that any potential benefits of piracy can be internalized through product sampling. Two counterintuitive results stand out. First, piracy losses are more severe for products that do not live up to their hype rather than for those that have been undervalued in the market, thus requiring a greater deterrence investment for the former, and second, unlike physical goods where sampling is always beneficial for underestimated products, sampling for digital goods is optimal only under narrowly defined circumstances due to the price boundaries created by both piracy and segmentation.},

Previous empirical work has mainly offered consumer- and/or product-based explanations for this phenomenon. In contrast, our research explores the key role played by vendors' price-format adoption in explaining price dispersion. We empirically analyze over a half-million online and offline prices offered by major U.S. airlines in the top 500 domestic markets. Our study shows that a vendor's price format remains an important source of price dispersion in both channels even after accounting for other factors known to impact dispersion in airline ticket prices. Importantly, this finding is true for both transacted and posted tickets. We document several other interesting empirical findings. First, the lower variance in the prices of “everyday low price” (EDLP) firms serves to reduce the market-level dispersion in prices when such firms are present. Moreover, the price variance of non-EDLP firms in these markets is also lower than in those markets in which EDLP competitors are absent. Second, we also find that dispersion in offered prices increases closer to the departure date, which is consistent with theoretical assertion that price dispersion increases with reservation prices. Finally, we continue to observe dispersion of online prices even after accounting for vendor strategy and other known sources of dispersion, suggesting that the prices are unlikely to converge even in the presence of sophisticated online search mechanisms.},

Examining contract structures yields important insights into how the contracting parties structure the governance provisions and the factors or transaction risks that influence them. Based on insights from prior literature, from practicing legal experts, and through in-depth content analysis of actual contracts, we develop a comprehensive coding scheme to capture contract provisions across four major dimensions: monitoring, dispute resolution, property rights protection, and contingency provisions. We then develop an empirical data set describing the contract structures across these distinct dimensions, using a sample of 112 ITO contracts from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) database from 1993 to 2003. Drawing on transaction cost, agency, and relational exchange theories, we hypothesize the effects of transaction and relational characteristics on the specific contractual provisions, as well as on overall contract extensiveness. Furthermore, we examine how these associations vary under conditions of fixed price and time and materials pricing structures. The results provide good support for the main hypotheses of the study and yield interesting insights about contractual governance of ITO arrangements.},

We employ a panel vector autoregression model to investigate the interrelationship between broadcasting promotions in social media and music sales, while controlling for influential factors such as advertising in traditional media channels, album prices, new music releases, user-generated content, and artist popularity. We characterize two types of broadcast messages in the MySpace context, personal and automated. We find that broadcasting in social media has a significant effect on sales even after controlling for the aforementioned factors, and more important, the effect mainly comes from personal messages rather than automated messages. We also show that the timing and content of personal messages play a role in affecting sales.

Despite a significant body of academic research in this area, a commonly held but questionable assumption in these studies is that noncompliance simply represents the opposite of compliance. Hence, explaining compliance is only half of the story, and there is a pressing need to understand the causes of noncompliance, as well. If organizational leaders understood what leads a normally compliant employee to become noncompliant, future security breaches might be avoided or minimized. In this study, we found that compliant and noncompliant behaviors can be better explained by uncovering actions that focus not only on efficacious coping behaviors, but also those that focus on frustrated users who must sometimes cope with emotions, too. Employees working from a basis of emotion-focused coping are unable to address the threat and, feeling overwhelmed, focus only on controlling their emotions, merely making themselves feel better. Based on our findings, organizations can enhance their security by understanding the “tipping point” where employees’ focus likely changes from problem-solving to emotion appeasement, and instead push them into a more constructive direction.Yan Chen is an associate professor at Florida International University.

This externality arises because of the public nature of online interactions. However, prior studies were mainly in offline settings where such externality rarely exists. In this study, we assess the magnitude of such externality. Using a difference-in-difference-in-differences framework and matched hotels across two large travel agencies, we find that managerial responses indeed have a significant and positive impact on the volume of subsequent customer reviews. The impact on the review valence is not evident, which can be attributed to the unique design of identity disclosure in our research context. Furthermore, our results suggest nuances that were not known in the prior literature. For example, responding to positive and negative reviews may have different effects on future reviews, and managers should provide detailed responses to negative reviews but brief ones to positive reviews. Our results offer managerial implications to service providers on how to improve customer engagement in the interconnected online environment.

We then examine how systems usage, service design, and other firm and individual-level factors affect switching and retention. Using data on the online brokerage industry, we find significant variation (as much as a factor of two) in measured switching costs. We find that customer demographic characteristics have little effect on switching, but that systems usage measures and systems quality are associated with reduced switching. We also find that firm characteristics such as product line breadth and quality reduce switching and may also reduce customer attrition. Overall, we conclude that online brokerage firms appear to have different abilities in retaining customers and have considerable control over their switching costs.},

Our results also show that, whereas ratings based on verified purchasers are informative of objective product values, the current Amazon review system appears to have limited ability to resolve fit uncertainty.

These markets look like true spot markets for tasks rather than markets for employment. Despite appearances, we find via a field experiment that workers act more like parties to an employment contract: workers quickly form wage reference points and react negatively to proposed wage cuts by quitting. However, they can be mollified with “reasonable” justifications for why wages are being cut, highlighting the importance of fairness considerations in their decision making. We find some evidence that “unreasonable” justifications for wage cuts reduce subsequent work quality. We also find that not explicitly presenting the worker with a decision about continuing to work eliminates “quits,” with no apparent reduction in work quality. One interpretation for this finding is that workers have a strong expectation that they are party to a quasi-employment relationship where terms are not changed, and the default behavior is to continue working.},

We examine three options for the seller to conduct the second-degree (indirect) price discrimination: by minutes, by gigabytes (Gigs), and by megabytes per second (Mbps). We show that the after-sales self-selection behaviors have a significant impact on the seller’s profitability, and it leads to a first-order influence on the pricing metric selection. We prove that either pricing by Gigs or Mbps can be optimal. Pricing by Gigs can dominate pricing by Mbps even if the consumer’s utility is more sensitive in changes in the connection speed. We also find that when incorporating the bandwidth costs or congestion costs, pricing by Mbps becomes more attractive as it allows the seller to directly control the congestion effect. These findings may help practitioners to develop their own pricing plans and pricing metrics selection.},

It reveals that the extracted dynamic networks provide additional value in predicting firm equity value over current adopted supply chain and coindustry networks, after controlling for market activities and other traditional indicators from news, such as volume, sentiment, and comentions. In practice, such cobenefit/counter-benefit networks provide good buy and sell signals, which enrich known indicators and support more complex trading strategies in investment and portfolio management. The analysis and visualization of the extracted cobenefit/counter-benefit networks are also useful in understanding the structure of the economy and assessing firm/industry changes in a timelier fashion.},

Our research sheds new light on how to combine domain knowledge and patient data in developing effective decision-support tools for clinical use. Although our research is specifically geared toward radiotherapy planning for breast cancer, the design principles of our framework can be applied to the personalization of treatment plans for patients with other chronic diseases that typically involve complications and comorbidities.},

To alleviate this problem, some providers have launched a low-priority service with the so-called preemptible or spot instances, which allows them to reclaim capacities when necessary. This study focuses on an emerging market segment of customers with fault-tolerant computing jobs, who are the potential users of the preemptible instances. Through an analytical model that captures the underlying supply-demand dynamics, we examine a prevalent discount scheme, which provides all users the same discount, and its impact on key performance measures. Having realized that this is a relatively new market segment and there is room for improvement in discount-scheme designs, we propose an interruption-based discount scheme, which provides compensation to users based on the frequency of interruptions encountered by each of them. Our study suggests that the proposed scheme is fairer than the prevalent scheme from the customers’ perspective and that, in the presence of risk-averse customers, the cloud provider could be better off by adopting the proposed scheme when the supply of the surplus capacity is highly uncertain.},

   abstract                      = {This paper considers on-demand services and its impact on market structure, firm profitability, and consumer welfare. The unique properties of on-demand services are the conversion of fixed costs to variable costs, removal of capacity constraint, and fast setup time (which enables quick entry by any firm at any time when there is opportunity), whereas privacy and security concerns and switching costs have been noted as the biggest barriers from adopting on-demand services. With a stylized model capturing these benefits and barriers to using on-demand services, we establish several results. First, we show that conversion of fixed cost to variable cost enables new and small firms to enter existing markets and leads to the creation of new markets. Second, we show that competition and the threat of new entrants can be an important driver of a firm's decision to switch to on-demand services. In addition, a firm's barriers to using on-demand services can influence another firm's entry decision. Third, we show that two identical firms may employ different technologies in equilibrium. Fourth, we show that fast setup time and removal of capacity constraint associated with on-demand services make it impossible for firms to make supranormal return and would lead to a perfect competitive market, even when there is only one firm, under very general conditions. Such a result still holds even when there exists an economy of scale (e.g., quantity discount) from using on-demand services. On the other hand, when there are barriers preventing firms from offering similar products and products are substantially differentiated, on-demand services can amplify this advantage of entry barriers by enabling firms to further increase prices and enhance their profitability. Therefore, contrary to the common belief that offering on-demand services is best for firms offering commodity products, we show on-demand services to be more profitable for firms with differentiated products.},

The prediction results will enable the platform to increase the chance that the buyer and seller reach a transaction by presenting buyers with offerings that are more likely to lead to a transaction. Within the framework of the relational topic model, we embed a topic structure with both shared and corpus-specific topics to better handle text corpora generated from different sources. Our model facilitates the extraction of the appropriate topic structure from different document collections that helps enhance the transaction prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world data sets collected from sharing economy platforms demonstrate that our new model significantly outperforms other alternatives. The robust results obtained from multiple sets of comparisons demonstrate the value of bilateral reviews if they are processed properly. Our approach can be applied to many platforms where bilateral reviews are available.},

Nevertheless, CIO structural power should not be overlooked because it could amplify (i.e., positively moderate) the impact of CIO issue selling to digital innovation outcomes. In addition, we identify four enabling forces of CIO issue selling effectiveness: (1) CIO strategic decision-making authority, (2) CIO/TMT partnership, (3) CIO information technologies (IT)–related strategic knowledge, and (4) CIO political savvy. Matched-pair survey data collected from senior business and IT executives of 179 organizations largely support the research hypotheses.},

We develop a game-theoretic model to address two critical issues of NN: (1) Who are gainers and losers of abandoning NN? (2) Will broadband service providers have greater incentive to expand their capacity without NN? We find that if the principle of NN is abolished, the broadband service provider stands to gain from the arrangement, as a result of extracting the preferential access fees from content providers. Content providers are thus left worse off, mirroring the stances of the two sides in the debate. Depending on parameter values in our framework, consumer surplus either does not change or is higher in the short run. When compared to the baseline case under NN, social welfare in the short run increases if one content provider pays for preferential treatment but remains unchanged if both content providers pay. Finally, we find that the incentive to expand infrastructure capacity for the broadband service provider and its optimal capacity choice under NN are higher than those under the no-net-neutrality (NNN) regime, except in some specific cases. Under NN, the broadband service provider always invests in broadband infrastructure at the socially optimal level but either under- or overinvests in infrastructure capacity in the absence of NN.},

Bivariate vector autoregressive model results show that within-market autoregressive pricing effects are larger than across-market effects. We also document that over 70% of the relative price discovery occurs in the East market. Our regression results further show that East–West latency differentials have a significantly positive effect on East–West pricing differentials. Latency creates a dynamic pricing wedge that widens or narrows conditional on the latency differentials. Using an error correction model, the speed of adjustment from long-run pricing convergence errors causes the short-run price differential to narrow, but the adjustment does not completely offset the price differential.},

Within the IS discipline, a significant percentage of research has been devoted to examining the conditions and contexts under which relationships may vary, often under the general umbrella of contingency theory (cf. McKeen et al. 1994, Weill and Olson 1989). In our survey of such studies, the majority failed to either detect or provide an estimate of the effect size. In cases where effect sizes are estimated, the numbers are generally small. These results have led some researchers to question both the usefulness of contingency theory and the need to detect interaction effects (e.g., Weill and Olson 1989). This paper addresses this issue by providing a new latent variable modeling approach that can give more accurate estimates of interaction effects by accounting for the measurement error that attenuates the estimated relationships. The capacity of this approach at recovering true effects in comparison to summated regression is demonstrated in a Monte Carlo study that creates a simulated data set in which the underlying true effects are known. Analysis of a second, empirical data set is included to demonstrate the technique's use within IS theory. In this second analysis, substantial direct and interaction effects of enjoyment on electronic-mail adoption are shown to exist.},

We find that the ISP’s optimal network management choice of data sponsorship crucially depends on market conditions, such as the revenue rates of CPs and the fit cost of consumers. If the fit cost is low, the ISP will either allow both CPs to subsidize consumers’ Internet access, or will allow only the more competitive CP to subsidize, depending on the per-consumer revenue generation rates of CPs. If the fit cost is high, it is in the ISPs interest not to allow any subsidization. We also identify conditions under which the ISP’s network management choices of data sponsorship deviate from social optimum. These results should be of interest to the telecom industry as it searches additional revenue models, and to online CPs competing for customer loyalty. It should also be of interest to policymakers investigating into this issue.},

   abstract                      = {For many products, particularly digital content, consumers base purchase-related decisions on not only others’ evaluations (e.g., online reviews) but also their own direct experiences (e.g., previews). Many of them therefore combine “seeing” through their own encounters with “believing” the assessments of others, often being confronted with a situation wherein the former contradicts the latter. This study investigates the dynamics underlying the interactive relationships between online reviews and previews to shed light on how consumers collectively use these pre-buying resources as guidance in purchasing e-books. Our research reveals that consumers wisely leverage previews in accordance with the characteristics of reviews (e.g., volume, valence, and variance). The positive effects of previews increase with decreasing review volume and average valence. Consumers also rely heavily on previews in situations wherein a high variance exists among the indirect evaluations of reviewers. We detect the presence of order effects with respect to exposure to previews and reviews; exposure to previews after accessing reviews more effectively drives sales than when exposure to reviews precedes the encounters. These results provide content providers with useful managerial insights into how they can maximize consumers’ overall prepurchase experiences and enhance content sales through the excellent leveraging of previews and reviews.},

Why do competing sellers adopt different pricing schemes for the same information good? Pricing schemes affect buyers' usage levels and thus the revenue generated from different segments of buyers. This can allow competing firms in a duopoly to differentiate themselves by offering different pricing schemes. Such strategic use of pricing schemes can allow undifferentiated sellers to earn substantial profits in a friction-free market for a commoditized information good. These conditions would otherwise lead to the Bertrand equilibrium and zero profits. We show that adopting asymmetric pricing schemes can be a Nash equilibrium for information goods with negligible marginal cost of production. We extend our model to the case of information goods that are horizontally differentiated and show that sellers will offer a single-pricing scheme that is different from competitors when the sellers are weakly differentiated. When the sellers are strongly differentiated, each seller will offer multiple pricing schemes. We show that it can be optimal for a seller to offer multiple pricing schemes—metered and flat fee pricing schemes, even in the absence of transactions costs.},

Couponing impacts the seller’s profit in two ways: (i) impact on bidders’ entry probability including negative externalities for the bidder who does not receive a coupon and (ii) value extraction. We find that targeting a coupon to the low-valuation bidder can be optimal for the firm even if it leads to a reduction in the joint entry probability of the two bidders because of the benefit from value extraction. A novel result is that in the context of auctions it can be optimal for the seller to issue targeted coupons to the high-valuation bidder. We also find that an increase in the bidders’ valuation or reduction in the participation cost can lead to lower profit for the seller. This result is driven by the nonmonotonicity of the joint entry probability of the two bidders and the seller profits being nonmonotone functions of bidders’ valuations and participation costs.},

Traditionally, users are responsible for running on-premises software; by contrast, a vendor is responsible for running SaaS software, and the SaaS vendor incurs a larger proportion of defect-related costs than a vendor of on-premises software. We examine the effect of this difference on a vendor’s choice of when to release software and the proportion of software defects to fix. Surprisingly, we find that, despite incurring a larger proportion of defect-related costs, it is optimal for the SaaS vendor to release software earlier and with more defects, and to patch a smaller proportion of defects, than the on-premises software vendor. Even though the SaaS vendor incurs higher defect-related costs, he obtains a larger profit than the traditional vendor. In addition, we find that for a vendor who uses the SaaS model, the optimal number of defects after patching may be lower than the socially efficient outcome. This occurs despite the fact that the number of defects after patching in the SaaS model is higher than in the traditional on-premises model.},

With respect to development approach, a firm can develop an IOIS competitively or cooperatively. Based on a case study of the development of IOISs in the aircraft parts industry, two sets of transaction characteristics—demand uncertainty and market variability—were found to influence the choice of IOISs. Two factors—strategic significance of the IOIS, and size and bargaining power of the firm—were found to influence the choice of development approach. The observations from the case study are used to develop a set of propositions about when a firm will choose a particular IOIS and whether a cooperative or a competitive approach will be used.},

To this end, the camp was designed in partnership with a number of corporations, and included as a central element a series of experiential opportunities for participants. Each day of the camp featured a visit to a corporation where the students took part in a hands-on activity that involved solving a business problem with IT. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations indicate that the camp was very successful in changing students' perceptions about the nature of IT work and the IT job market. We believe the camp can be a useful tool to create a pipeline of well-informed students interested in IT careers.

The portfolios of control in outsourced projects are dominated by outcome controls, especially at the start of the project; although the precision and frequency of these controls varies across projects. Behavior controls are often added later in the project, as are controls aimed to encourage and enable vendor self–control. Clan controls were used in only two of the cases—when the client and vendor had shared goals, and when frequent interactions led to shared values. In general, the outsourced projects we studied began with relatively simple controls but often required significant additional controls after experiencing performance problems. Factors influencing the choice and evolution of controls are also examined.},

By contrast, firms with a software patent portfolio exhibiting high levels of exploitative innovation orientation achieve higher market value in low competitiveness and high dynamism environments. Although some practitioners are still skeptical about the value of software patents, we provide empirical evidence that a firm’s software patents do contribute to firm performance, thereby helping practitioners to justify their investments in software innovation and assess the value of their software patents. Furthermore, our paper highlights key factors—both internal (i.e., innovation orientation) and external (i.e., environmental uncertainty)—that may affect the value of software patents. This can help firms formulate the appropriate innovation strategy for software patents that can lead to the greatest returns.},

By testing all these factors together in one model, we are able to investigate their relative contributions to EDI adoption decisions. Senior purchasing managers, chosen for their experience with EDI and proximity to the EDI adoption decision, were surveyed and their responses analyzed using structural equation modeling. All three determinants were found to be significant predictors of intent to adopt EDI, with external pressure and readiness being considerably more important than perceived benefits. We show that the constructs in this model can be categorized into three levels: technological, organizational, and interorganizational. We hypothesize that these categories of influence will also be determinants of the adoption of other emerging forms of interorganizational systems (IOS). 1},

However, it is unclear whether these results hold, given recent IT innovations and continued price declines. In this study we extend prior research to examine whether these input relationships have evolved over time. First, we introduce new price indexes to account for varying technological progress across different types of IT hardware. Second, we use the rental price methodology to measure capital in terms of the flow of services provided. Finally, we use hedonic methods to extend our IT measures to 1998, enabling analysis spanning the emergence of the Internet. Analyzing approximately 9,800 observations from over 800 Fortune 1,000 firms for the years 1987–1998, we find firm demand for IT to be elastic for decentralized IT and inelastic for centralized IT. Moreover, Allen Elasticity of Substitution estimates confirm that through labor substitution, the increasing factor share of IT comes at the expense of labor. Last, we identify a complementary relationship between IT and ordinary capital, suggesting an evolution in this relationship as firms have shifted to more decentralized organizational forms. We discuss these results in terms of prior research, suggest areas of future research, and discuss managerial implications. *This paper is dedicated to the memory of Paul Chwelos, respected colleague and dear friend.},

   abstract                      = {A core activity in information systems development involves building a conceptual model of the domain that an information system is intended to support. Such models are created using a conceptual-modeling (CM) grammar. Just as high-quality conceptual models facilitate high-quality systems development, high-quality CM grammars facilitate high-quality CM. This paper provides a new perspective on ways to improve the quality of the semantics of CM grammars. For many years, the leading approach to this topic has relied on ontological theory. We show, however, that the ontological approach captures only half the story; it needs to be coupled with a logical approach. We explain how the ontological and logical qualities of CM grammars interrelate. Furthermore, we outline three contributions of a logical approach to evaluating the quality of CM grammars: a means of seeing some familiar CM problems in simpler ways, illumination of new problems, and proving the benefit of modifying existing CM grammars in particular ways. We demonstrate these benefits in the context of the Entity-Relationship grammar. More generally, our paper opens a new area of research with many opportunities for future research and practice.},

Using data from Seeking Alpha, the authors find that fake news stories generate significantly more attention than a control sample of legitimate articles. The authors find no evidence that article commenters can detect fake news, and they find that Seeking Alpha editors have only modest ability to detect fake news. However, the authors implement several well-known machine learning algorithms based on linguistic characteristics and show that machine learning algorithms can successfully identify fake news. In addition, the stock market appears to price fake news correctly. While abnormal trading volume increases around the release of fake news, the increase is less than that observed for legitimate news. The stock price reaction to fake news is discounted when compared with legitimate news articles.},

Other drivers of app success are also affected by the rule change; sheer network size became a less important driver for app success, update frequency benefitted apps more in staying successful, and active users of Facebook apps declined less rapidly with age. Our results show that social media channels do not necessarily have to be managed through hard exclusion of participants but can also be steered through “softer” changes in reward and incentive systems.},

Information technology (IT) could provide more automated markets, which have lower costs. Yet for an electronic trading system to form a liquid and widely used market, a sufficient number of traders would need to make a transition away from established trading venues and to this alternative way of trading. This transition may not actually occur for a variety of reasons. Two tests are performed of the feasibility and the desirability of transitions to new markets. In the first test, traders in a series of economic experiments demonstrate an ability to make a transition and develop a critical mass of trading activity in a newly opened market. In the second test, simulation is used to compare the floor-based specialist auction in place in most U.S. stock exchanges today to a disintermediated alternative employing screen-based order matching. The results indicate that reducing the role of dealer-intermediaries can actually diminish important measures of market quality. Our findings suggest that the low trading volumes on many off-exchange systems do not result from traders' inability to break away from established trading floors. Rather, today's off-exchange trading systems are not uniformly superior to the trading mechanisms of traditional exchanges. Thus, regulatory actions favoring off-exchange trading systems are not warranted; but, improved designs for IT-based trading mechanisms are needed, and when these are available, they are likely to win significant trading volume from established exchanges.},

   abstract                      = {Numerous proposals for extending the relational data model to incorporate the temporal dimension of data have appeared over the past decade. It has long been known that these proposals have adopted one of two basic approaches to the incorporation of time into the extended relational model. Recent work formally contrasted the expressive power of these two approaches, termed temporally ungrouped and temporally grouped, and demonstrated that the temporally grouped models are more expressive. In the temporally ungrouped models, the temporal dimension is added through the addition of some number of distinguished attributes to the schema of each relation, and each tuple is “stamped” with temporal values for these attributes. By contrast, in temporally grouped models the temporal dimension is added to the types of values that serve as the domain of each ordinary attribute, and the application's schema is left intact. The recent appearance of TSQL2, a temporal extension to the SQL-92 standard based upon the temporally ungrouped paradigm, means that it is likely that commercial DBMS's will be extended to support time in this weaker way. Thus the distinction between these two approaches—and its impact on the day-to-day user of a DBMS—is of increasing relevance to the database practitioner and the database user community. In this paper we address this issue from the practical perspective of such a user. Through a series of example queries and updates, we illustrate the differences between these two approaches and demonstrate that the temporally grouped approach more adequately captures the semantics of historical data.},

To demonstrate, we used a widely cited study of IS spending. In that study, price-adjusted diffusion models were proposed to explain and to forecast aggregate U.S. information systems spending. That study concluded that such models would produce more accurate forecasts than would simple linear trend extrapolation. However, one can argue that the validation procedure provided an advantage to the diffusion models. We reexamined the results using an alternative validation procedure based on three principles extracted from forecasting research: (1) use ex ante (out-of-sample) performance rather than the fit to the historical data, (2) use well-accepted models as a basis for comparison, and (3) use an adequate sample of forecasts. Validation using this alternative procedure did confirm the importance of the price-adjustment, but simple trend extrapolations were found to be more accurate than the price-adjusted diffusion models.},

This research examined the training process, and compared a behavior modeling training program, based on Social Cognitive Theory (Bandura [Bandura, A. 1977. Self-efficacy: Toward a unifying theory of behavioral change. Psych. Rev. 84(2) 191–215; Bandura, A. 1978. Reflections on self-efficacy. Adv. Behavioral Res. Therapy 1 237–269; Bandura, A. 1982.

According to Social Cognitive Theory, watching others performing a behavior, in this case interacting with a computer system, influences the observers' perceptions of their own ability to perform the behavior, or self-efficacy, and the expected outcomes that they perceive, as well as providing strategies for effective performance. The findings provide only partial support for the research model. Self-efficacy exerted a strong influence on performance in both models. In addition, behavior modeling was found to be more effective than the traditional method for training in Lotus 1-2-3, resulting in higher self-efficacy and higher performance. For WordPerfect, however, modeling did not significantly influence performance. This finding was unexpected, and several possible explanations are explored in the discussion. Of particular surprise were the negative relationships found between outcome expectations and performance. Outcome expectations were expected to positively influence performance, but the results indicated a strong negative effect. Measurement limitations are presented as the most plausible explanation for this result, but further research is necessary to provide conclusive explanations.},

In this latter arena, however, the debate has become increasingly like a script—the actors (authors and reviewers) simply read their parts of the script; some avoid the underlying issues whereas others cursorily address generalizability without real consideration of those issues. As a result, despite the extent of debate, we seem no closer to a resolution. Authors who use student subjects rely on their scripted arguments to justify the use of student subjects and do not always consider whether those arguments are valid. But reviewers who oppose the use of student subjects are equally culpable. They, too, rely on scripted arguments to criticize work using student subjects, and do not always consider whether those arguments are salient to the particular study. By presenting and reviewing one version of this script in the context of theoretical discussions of generalizability, we hope to demonstrate its limitations so that we can move beyond these scripted arguments into a more meaningful discussion. To do this, we review empirical studies from the period 1990–2010 to examine the extent to which student subjects are being used in the field and to critically assess the discussions within the field about the use of student samples. We conclude by presenting recommendations for authors and reviewers, for determining whether the use of students is appropriate in a particular context, and for presenting and discussing work that uses student subjects.},

Like most previous methods, the development and promotion of these methods have been almost entirely driven by practitioners and consultants, with little participation from the research community during the early stages of evolution. While these methods are now the focus of more and more research efforts, most studies are still based on XP, Scrum, and other industry-driven foundations, with little or no conceptual studies of ISD agility in existence. As a result, this study proposes that there are a number of significant conceptual shortcomings with agile methods and the associated literature in its current state, including a lack of clarity, theoretical glue, parsimony, limited applicability, and naivety regarding the evolution of the concept of agility in fields outside systems development. Furthermore, this has significant implications for practitioners, rendering agile method comparison and many other activities very difficult, especially in instances such as distributed development and large teams that are not conducive to many of the commercial agile methods. This study develops a definition and formative taxonomy of agility in an ISD context, based on a structured literature review of agility across a number of disciplines, including manufacturing and management where the concept originated, matured, and has been applied and tested thoroughly over time. The application of the texonomy in practice is then demonstrated through a series of thought trials conducted in a large multinational organization. The intention is that the definition and taxonomy can then be used as a starting point to study ISD method agility regardless of whether the method is XP or Scrum, agile or traditional, complete or fragmented, out-of-the-box or in-house, used as is or tailored to suit the project context.},

A theory of information sharing is advanced and we report the results of three experiments on attitudes about sharing technical work and expertise in organizations. Based on research on sensitive topics difficult to study in the field, we derived vignette-based measures of attitudes. Subjects read a description of an employee's encounter with a previously unhelpful coworker who subsequently requested help—in the form of a computer program or computer advice. The influence of prosocial attitudes and organizational norms is inferred from subjects' support of sharing despite the previous unhelpful behavior of the coworker. Experiments 1 and 3 demonstrated that greater self interest reduces support of sharing, but that a belief in organizational ownership of work encourages and mediates attitudes favoring sharing. Work experience and business schooling contribute to these attitudes. The theory asserts that information as expertise belongs to a special category of information that is part of people's identity and is self-expressive. Experiments 2 and 3 demonstrated that subjects felt computer expertise belonged more to its possessor than the computer program did but would share it more than the program. Hence, attitudes about information sharing depend on the form of the information. Sharing tangible information work may depend on prosocial attitudes and norms of organizational ownership; sharing expertise may depend on people's own self-expressive needs.},

We identify two possible solutions proposed in the literature, one emphasizing more top-down control and the need for a clear IT governance framework, and a second arguing for a more flexible approach since absolute control is impossible and only leads to drift and unintended outcomes. We suggest that there is a clear gap in the literature in better understanding how to govern the development of information infrastructures using a bottom-up approach. We build on research that approaches IS development as a collective action problem and focus on how different actors frame the infrastructure as a public and private good, and how the framing process is underpinned by actors’ different ideologies. We use our theoretical approach to examine the framing of the development of a regional health information infrastructure in Crete. Our analysis examines how different actors frame the infrastructure as a collective action good and explore their ideological positioning. We explore the struggle around meanings attributed to the good over time as being a public or private one in establishing or sustaining relations of power, and how legitimacy is challenged or reinforced. Finally, we develop contributions on the collective action challenges in infrastructure development and suggest how a polycentric approach to governance might be further developed to promote the ongoing cultivation of information infrastructures from the bottom up.},

Our motivation for undertaking this special issue rests in the conviction that it is significant to discuss platforms and infrastructures concomitantly, while enabling knowledge from diverse disciplines to cross-pollinate to address critical, pressing policy challenges and inform strategic thinking across both social and business spheres. In this editorial, we review key insights from the literature on digital infrastructures and platforms, present emerging research themes, highlight the contributions developed from each of the six articles in this special issue, and conclude with suggestions for further research.},

   abstract                      = {Data breaches are now a daily occurrence. What corporate leaders may not realize is that certain actions they are taking in the social responsibility space may, in fact, be placing a proverbial target on their backs. Indeed, there is evidence that the hacking community is not homogeneous, and at least some hackers from both internal and external sources appear to be motivated by what they dislike as opposed to solely financial gain. Recent hacks against the World Health Organization, as a result of its actions (or supposed inactions) related to the COVID-19 pandemic, are a case in point. In this paper, we put forth the idea that espoused positive social performance in areas that are peripheral to core business operations (e.g., philanthropy, recycling programs) can be a detriment to information security, particularly when firms have simultaneous high levels of social concerns (e.g., poor employee relations, product safety concerns, involvement in an environmental controversy). Our results support this outcome. It appears that some perpetrators can “sniff out” firm social actions that attempt to give the appearance of social responsibility and possibly mask poor social performance, and consequently, these firms are victimized by a malicious data breach more often.},

   abstract                      = {Information and communication technology (ICT) has continuously reshaped the way in which businesses operate. Yet opinions among economists about the returns to ICT, especially at the aggregate level, are divided. We exploit business-to-business transaction panel data from ICT producers to construct ICT capital stocks for a large sample of Belgian firms. This allows us to estimate the returns to ICT at the firm level and to investigate how firm-level ICT investments affected aggregate gross domestic product and productivity. We find large returns to ICT—more precisely, a firm investing an additional euro in ICT—increases value added by 1 euro and 35 cents on average. This marginal product of ICT investment increases with firm size and varies across sectors. Although we find substantial returns to ICT at the firm level, returns are much lower at the aggregate level. This is due to underinvestment in ICT (ICT capital deepening is low) and because firms with especially high returns are underinvesting.},

Although the effect of mobile money has been examined in the past, we look at the supply side effects as it is important for managers to understand the role of mobile money in both providing social good and making a profit. From 1G to 4G mobile technologies, mobile money consistently serves as a competitive advantage for mobile network operators (MNOs). However, this does not mean that the effect stays unchanged over the generations of mobile technology. Instead, when the 3G technology allows web browsing as a major upgrade of mobile functionality, MNOs with mobile money have a substantially larger set of options to differentiate from those without mobile money; and as a result, mobile money implemented with 3G and 4G leads to larger market shares than that with 1G and 2G.},

   abstract                      = {A repeated challenge in launching a two-sided market platform is how to ignite the cross-side network effects to jump-start adoption. This research note studies “piggybacking”—expanding the focal market to recruit exclusive users from external networks—as a new and nonpricing control to launch platforms in conjunction with pricing controls. We first consider consumer-side piggybacking. Our results provide a rich set of novel insights into strategies that platforms use to monetize exclusive access to external users with nontrivial characterizations of the interplay among piggybacking, cross-side network effects, and price competition. We identify conditions when piggybacking is profit improving and when it leads to a prisoner’s dilemma, depending on the piggybacking cost and strengths of cross-side network effects. Among others, we show that piggybacking may intensify rather than ease price competition. We then consider provider-side piggybacking, and we show that the insights are qualitatively the same as consumer-side piggybacking except that the prisoner’s dilemma disappears if piggybacking providers multihome.},

   abstract                      = {This research examines the economic impact of membership-based free-shipping (MFS) programs when introduced as an augmentation to widely accepted contingent free-shipping (CFS) policies. Under CFS, consumers waive the shipping surcharge if the order exceeds a certain threshold, whereas under MFS, consumers pay an upfront fee and enjoy the free-shipping perk throughout the membership period. We develop a stylized model that considers consumer heterogeneity in two dimensions: (1) disutility from acquiring an auxiliary product—a product that consumers would not otherwise purchase—to qualify for CFS; and (2) shopping frequency over a given period. Our analysis suggests that the introduction of MFS allows the e-tailer to segment the market further, which could lead to a higher product price. When the disutility from acquiring an auxiliary product is moderate, the e-tailer should charge a high membership fee to target only frequent shoppers who forgo CFS. However, the e-tailer should lower the fee to lure also (1) frequent shoppers who would otherwise take CFS, when the disutility is high; or (2) infrequent shoppers who would otherwise forgo CFS, when the disutility is low. In all cases, although the collected fee revenue can never compensate for the cost arising from offering the free-shipping perk, the loss can be recouped as a desirable outcome of a more segmented market. Our research generates insights into the optimal design of e-tailers’ shipping policies, shedding light on the practical challenges that confront e-tailers.},

We distinguish the conditions for flows of tacit and explicit knowledge in online communities and advance an unconventional theoretical conjecture: Online communities give rise to tacit knowledge flows between participants. The crucial condition for these flows is not the advent of novel, digital technology as often portrayed in the literature, but instead the technology’s domestication by humanity and the sociality it affords. This conjecture holds profound implications for theory and research in the study of management and organization, as well as their relation to information technology.},

   abstract                      = {We study platform firms’ decision to recognize innovative products by complementors ex post through awards. We find that awards—despite being purely symbolic—might set incentives for complementors’ product strategies that can eventually lead to both desirable and undesirable outcomes for the platform firm. First, awards encourage recipients to focus on releasing complement improvements rather than new complements. Second, awards increases recipients’ likelihood of multihoming. Finally, awards increase new complement releases in the recipients’ market niche by attracting other complementors. Firms can directly benefit from the analyses presented in this study. For platform firms, this study’s results suggest that awards have significant effects on complementors’ behavior despite representing only symbolic and nonfinancial mechanisms. Platform managers should consider the flexibility of awards as a particular strength: an award can, for instance, be given to “the best complement” with no need to define the criteria exactly. Nevertheless, platform managers should be aware that employing awards requires a careful evaluation of whether their effects are desirable. Given that awards can encourage multihoming, platform managers are advised to employ additional mechanisms to increase recipients’ loyalty to the platform, for example, through contractual exclusivity arrangements.},

   abstract                      = {Can machines outperform crowds in financial lending decisions? Using data from a crowd-lending platform, we show that, compared with portfolios created by crowds, a reasonably sophisticated machine can construct financial portfolios that provide better returns while controlling for risk. Further, we find that the machine-created portfolios benefit not only the lenders, but also the borrowers. Borrowers receive loans at a much lower interest rate as the machine can weed out the riskiest loans better than the crowds. We also find suggestive evidence of algorithmic bias in machine decisions. We find that, compared with women, men are more likely to receive loans by machine. We propose a general and effective “debiasing” method that can be applied to any prediction-focused machine learning (ML) applications. We show that the debiased ML algorithm, which suffers from lower prediction accuracy, still improves the crowd’s investment decisions in our context. Our results indicate that ML can help crowd-lending platforms better fulfill the promise of providing access to financial resources to otherwise underserved individuals and ensure fairness in the allocation of these resources.},

   abstract                      = {Despite the growing popularity of online public funding for education (i.e., crowdfunding), controversy persists about whether teachers’ efforts to use this channel are justified and whether donations thus received can actually make a difference in students’ academic performance. We present the first empirical evidence of the positive influence of online education crowdfunding after teachers successfully raise funds. Using data from California public school teachers and their students, as well as the teachers’ fundraising activities on DonorsChoose.org , we find significant academic performance improvements among students after their teachers receive donations through this platform. Such improvements in students’ academic performance are stronger when more local donors participate in teachers’ fundraising campaigns. Notably, teachers who attempt to raise funds online but are unsuccessful are still able to improve their students’ performance. These findings not only document the positive impact of online education crowdfunding on students’ academic performance, but also demonstrate that such impacts are at least partially attributable to the nonfinancial motivational benefits on teachers from receiving such donations. Our study therefore contributes to the literature on crowdfunding, as well as the ongoing debates surrounding the financing of public education.},

Many crowdfunding platforms have started using robo-advisors to help lenders augment their intelligence in P2P loan investments. Collaborating with one of the leading P2P companies, we examine how investors use robo-advisors and how the human adjustment of robo-advisor usage affects investment performance. Our analyses show that, somewhat surprisingly, investors who need more help from robo-advisors—that is, those encountered more defaults in their manual investing—are less likely to adopt such services. Investors tend to adjust their usage of the service in reaction to recent robo-advisor performance. However, interestingly, these human-in-the-loop interferences often lead to inferior performance.},

   abstract                      = {Although retailers recognize the potential value of sharing transactional data with supply chain partners, many remain reluctant to share. However, there is evidence that the extent of sharing would be greater if information sensitive to retailers can be concealed before sharing. Extant research has only considered sensitive information at the organizational level. This is rarely the case in reality; the retail industry has adapted their offerings to region-wide differences in customer tastes for decades. Differences in customer characteristics across regions lead to region-specific sensitive information in addition to any at the organizational level. This is the first paper to propose an approach to solve this version of the problem. Region-level requirements increase the size of an already difficult (NP-hard) problem substantially, making adaptations of existing approaches impractical. We present an ensemble approach that draws intuition from Lagrangian relaxation to conceal sensitive patterns at the organizational and regional levels with minimal damage to the data set. Extensive computational experiments show that it identifies optimal or near-optimal solutions even when other approaches fail, doing so without any loss in recommendation effectiveness. This mitigates potential risks associated with sharing and should increase data sharing among partners in the supply chain.},

   abstract                      = {Crowdfunding aims to collect investments from many backers to support a project posted by fundraisers. This study examines how backers respond to the lottery—a type of probabilistic uncertain reward—and how their motivations shape their responses to probabilistic uncertain rewards. Using data collected from a reward-based crowdfunding platform, we find that although the lottery helps to attract a higher number of backers on a crowdfunding project, the lottery also reduces the total money raised by the project and thus the probability of reaching its funding goal. Specifically, although the lottery incentivizes individuals who would otherwise not fund the project to become (small) lottery backers, the lottery also cannibalizes regular prospective rewardees and donors by encouraging them to opt for the (cheaper) lottery option. Second, the effects of the lottery are stronger in the earlier stages of a project’s fundraising cycle. Third, the lottery has larger effects on backers with higher prior tendencies to be donors than rewardees. Notably, from a practical standpoint, our study informs fundraisers on how to design strategies to attract the right type of backers and crowdfunding platform managers on how to leverage the lottery as a type of probabilistic uncertain reward on crowdfunding platforms.},

   abstract                      = {Design theories provide explicit prescriptions, such as principles of form and function, for constructing an artifact that is designed to meet a set of defined requirements and solve a problem. Design theory generation is increasing in importance because of the increasing number and diversity of problems that require the participation and proactive involvement of academic researchers to build and test artifact-based solutions. However, we have little understanding of how design theories are generated. Drawing on key contributions by Herbert A. Simon, including the ideas of satisfice and bounded rationality and reviewing a large body of information systems and problem-solving literature, we develop a normative framework for proactive design theorizing based on the notion of heuristic theorizing. Heuristics are rules of thumb that provide a plausible aid in structuring the problem at hand or in searching for a satisficing artifact design. An example of a problem-structuring heuristic is problem decomposition and an example of an artifact design heuristic is analogical design. We define heuristic theorizing as the process of proactively generating design theory for prescriptive purposes from problem-solving experiences and prior theory by constantly iterating between the search for a satisficing problem solution, i.e., heuristic search, and the synthesis of new information that is generated during heuristic search, i.e., heuristic synthesis. Heuristic search involves alternating between structuring the problem at hand and generating new artifact design components, whereas heuristic synthesis involves different ways of thinking, including reflection and learning and forms of reasoning, that complement the use of heuristics for theorizing purposes. We illustrate the effectiveness of our heuristic theorizing framework through a detailed example of a multiyear design science research program in which we proactively generated a design theory for solving problems in the area of intelligent information management and so-called big data in the finance domain. We propose that heuristic theorizing is a useful alternative to established theorizing approaches, i.e., reasoning-based approaches. Heuristic theorizing is particularly relevant for proactive design theorizing, which emphasizes problem solving as being highly intertwined with theorizing, involves a greater variety of ways of thinking than other theorizing approaches, and assumes an engaged relationship between academics and practitioners.},

   abstract                      = {The virtualization of every aspect of our life does not mean that old ways of social interaction can now be transported to the internet. According to recent research conducted on the influence of mobile apps, we also need to look at how digital spaces enable interactions among individuals. We use large-scale geospatial data analysis to study millions of postings in an app called Waze. We conceptualize a novel factor called virtual crowdedness, which is the density of usage of the app in a specific neighborhood. We find that displaying the density of a user’s “virtual activities” can both encourage and discourage participation by the entire community. We find that participation in virtual settings is akin to what economists describe as a public good, where only a few individuals contribute but create well-being for the entire community. Users’ motivation to participate in virtual settings depends on what is termed “impure altruism” by economists, where participation is heavily influenced by motives of prestige and public recognition. These motivations are reinforced through intensive social interactions among members of such communities. We also find there is a strong bystander effect in these virtual communities. The bystander effect refers to the phenomenon in which an individual’s likelihood of engaging in a helpful act decreases when bystanders are present in a critical situation.},

We argue that DSB risk cannot be mitigated by one executive alone, but, rather, is a shared leadership responsibility of the top management team (TMT) (i.e., Chief Executive Officer [CEO], Chief Financial Officer [CFO], and Chief Information Officer [CIO]). Our results suggest that IT-savvy CEOs see technologies related to mitigating DSBs as a top-three most important type of digital methodology for their firm. Similarly, the results related to CFOs with IT expertise single out the critical investment in controls designed to prevent DSBs. Our strong findings for CIOs on the TMT add to the related guidance from COBIT 5 for information security and consistently suggest that they are the key executive for securing IT systems. Finally, our granular explanation of each executive’s DSB-related responsibility could potentially provide firms the start of a governance-led roadmap for compliance to the Securities and Exchange Commission’s and Justice Department’s cyber regulations.},

Both content characteristics and creator characteristics have been examined for their influence on virality. But the relationships between them are rarely discussed. We propose an extension to our existing conceptual framework to study the interactions between content and creator variables. And we demonstrate the significance of the interactions using data from 800,000 tweets. We find that by adding content-–creator interactions, the predictive power of the model improves significantly, which underlines the importance of the interactions for studying virality in social media. We also provide insights for managers on shaping their social media presence and strategy to use social media popularity for marketing and brand building.},

   abstract                      = {One important decision faced by the owners of online marketplaces is whether they should enter the market and sell products directly to customers. In this study, we provide data-driven insights to managers by empirically investigating the impact of a platform owner’s entry on the demand of third-party stores and their potential reactions using transaction level data from a large e-commerce platform. Contrary to previous studies in mobile app platforms, our study shows that the demand of competing third-party stores decreases with the entry of the platform, especially for large third-party stores. We further show that the demand reduction is significant only in the offline channel and the reduction results from third-party stores’ defensive strategy to divert their offline customers away from the platform (i.e., disintermediation). Our findings indicate that platforms should carefully evaluate the nature of their markets before entering the market to compete with complementors, because they may lead third-party sellers to disintermediate from the platform. On the other hand, from the perspective of third-party sellers, disintermediation might be an overreaction to the entry of the platform, because their online demand is not significantly affected by platform entry based on our analyses.},

And then we introduce the articles appearing in this special section. We hope that our discussions of potential research directions and topics in FinTech will stimulate future research in the fields of information systems and finance toward making their unique marks in the FinTech evolution and the associated business and societal innovations.},

   abstract                      = {The growing ubiquity of GPS-enabled smartphones has ushered in a new era of location-based services and online-to-offline commerce. Geofencing is one instance of this broader phenomenon, and it is being widely adopted in the context of retail, restaurant, entertainment, and other local services. By targeting users on mobile apps while they are in the vicinity of physical establishments, there is potential for higher levels of engagement and consumption of the products or services on offer. However, the level of consumer interest is likely to depend on distance from the establishment and local competition in the surrounding areas. This study examines the impact of these two factors on consumer response to geofence advertising at different points in the purchase funnel, namely the click stage and conversion phase. Analyzing a rich data set from one of the leading location-based marketing agencies and using a sophisticated Bayesian empirical methodology, we find that having one more competitor in the consumer’s vicinity reduces click-through rate by about 1%, and a 1-mile increase in distance is associated with a 17.6% reduction in conversion rate. These and other results suggest that accounting for distance and local competition in data-analytic mobile targeting would increase both the return on advertising spend and consumer welfare.},

   abstract                      = {This paper discusses the value of context in theory development in information systems (IS) research. We examine how prior research has incorporated context in theorizing and develop a framework to classify existing approaches to contextualization. In addition, we expound on a decomposition approach to contextualization and put forth a set of guidelines for developing context-specific models. We illustrate the application of the guidelines by constructing and comparing various context-specific variations of the technology acceptance model (TAM)—i.e., the decomposed TAM that incorporates interaction effects between context-specific factors, the extended TAM with context-specific antecedents, and the integrated TAM that incorporates mediated moderation and moderated mediation effects of context-specific factors. We tested the models on 972 individuals in two technology usage contexts: a digital library and an agile Web portal. The results show that the decomposed TAM provides a better understanding of the contexts by revealing the direct and interaction effects of context-specific factors on behavioral intention that are not mediated by the TAM constructs of perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. This work contributes to the ongoing discussion about the importance of context in theory development and provides guidance for context-specific theorizing in IS research.},

   abstract                      = {This study examines the role of text-based direct messaging systems in online labor markets, which provide a communication channel between workers and employers, adding a personal touch to the exchange of online labor. We propose the effect of workers’ use of the direct messaging system on employers’ hiring decisions and conceptualize the information role of direct messaging. To empirically evaluate the information role of the direct messaging system, we leverage data on the direct messaging activities between workers and employers across more than 470,000 job applications on a leading online labor market. We report evidence that direct messaging with a prospective employer increases a worker’s probability of being hired by 8.9%. However, the degree to which workers benefit from direct messaging is heterogeneous, and the effect amplifies for workers approaching employers from a position of disadvantage (lacking tenure or fit with the job) and attenuates as more workers attempt to message the same prospective employer. The effects also depend on message content. In particular, we find that the benefits of direct messaging for workers depend a great deal on the politeness of the workers, and this “politeness effect” depends on several contextual factors. The beneficial effects are amplified for lower-status workers (i.e., workers lacking tenure and job fit) and workers who share a common language with the employer. At the same time, the beneficial effects weaken in the presence of typographical errors. These findings provide important insights into when and what to message to achieve favorable hiring outcomes in online employment settings.},

Unlike captive computing resources, cloud computing occurs as a pay-as-you-go contract, similar to the provision of electricity. We develop a method to reduce the rental cost of completing a given computing task with a certain deadline. The current practice is to use a single computing resource that can get the task done in the cheapest possible manner. Instead, costs can be significantly reduced if the task is switched between multiple resources, some more powerful and others less powerful. We apply our method to a real computing task at Cidewalk and show that costs can be significantly reduced.},

   abstract                      = {The gig economy comprises a large portion of the workforce in today’s economy. The gig economy has low barriers to entry, enabling flexible work arrangements and allowing workers to engage in contingent employment, whenever, and in some cases, such as online labor markets, wherever, workers desire. And many of the workers seek and complete work via digital platforms. However, there is a lack of understanding into the participation in such platforms. The growth of the gig economy has been partly attributed to technological advancements that enable flexible work environments. In this study, we consider the role of an alternative driver, economic downturns, and associated financial stressors in the offline economy, for example, unemployment. Our analysis combines data from a leading online labor market and various archival sources such as the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We find local economic conditions significantly impact the intensive and extensive margins of labor supply in online labor markets. And such impacts are heterogeneous across different county characteristics. Given the prominence of the gig economy, we believe more research is needed to understand gig-economy participation. It is notable that policy makers recently started to look at related issues, proposing laws to protect the gig workers, such as the recent California Assembly Bill 5.},

   abstract                      = {Monitoring and contract renegotiation are two common solutions for addressing information asymmetry and uncertainty between a client and a vendor of software outsourcing services. Monitoring is mostly applied in time-and-materials contracts, as a basis for inspecting and reimbursing the vendor’s efforts in system development. Renegotiation, by contrast, is deployed in fixed-price and time-and-materials contracts to mitigate the loss of surplus from uncertainty after system development. We investigate the interaction between monitoring and renegotiation and examine the corresponding contract choice problem. We find that the client benefits from renegotiation based on two effects: an uncertainty-resolution effect and a post-development incentive effect, which incentivizes the vendor to exert additional effort in system development. Monitoring does not resolve uncertainty, although it does encourage the vendor to exert additional effort, a pre-development incentive effect. Our analysis shows that the choice of renegotiation or monitoring depends on the interactions of the above effects, which are moderated by the renegotiation cost, monitoring cost, and bargaining power in renegotiation. When renegotiation cost is low: if the client has high bargaining power and low monitoring cost, monitoring and renegotiation are complements and both are selected; otherwise, the two instruments are substitutes and contract renegotiation is preferred. When renegotiation cost is high: monitoring substitutes for renegotiation and the client only chooses monitoring if the cost to do it is low; or else neither is used. Overall, this research shows that four appropriate contract strategies should be used under somewhat different circumstances. We further analyze the impacts of some other key aspects of software outsourcing and extend the base model to address two alternative situations to show the robustness of our findings. The results apply to a range of software reliability growth models, including when machine learning or cloud computing are used.},

   abstract                      = {We propose a novel two-stage data-analytic modeling approach to gamer matching for multiplayer video games. In the first stage, we build a hidden Markov model to capture how gamers' latent engagement state evolves as a function of their game-play experience and outcome and the relationship between their engagement state and game-play behavior. We estimate the model using a data set containing detailed information on 1,309 randomly sampled gamers' playing histories over 29 months. We find that high-, medium-, and low-engagement-state gamers respond differently to motivations, such as feelings of achievement and need for challenge. For example, a higher per-period total score (achievement) increases the engagement of gamers in a low or high engagement state but not those in a medium engagement state; gamers in a low or medium engagement state enjoy within-period score variation (challenge), but those in a high engagement state do not. In the second stage, we develop a matching algorithm that learns (predicts) the gamer's current engagement state on the fly and exploits that learning to match the gamer to a round to maximize game-play. Our algorithm increases gamer game-play volume and frequency by 4%–8% conservatively, leading to economically significant revenue gains for the company.},

   abstract                      = {Selling virtual items is one of the major revenue sources for online game operators. Therefore, the design of game currency systems is important. This research shows that the game currency exchange rate (e.g., $1 = 1,000 game currency is a higher rate than $1 = 10 game currency) affects price perception of virtual items. When the rate is not prominent in players’ minds (e.g., the rate is not mentioned or players have sufficient game currency in their account), players consider a virtual item as more expensive if the rate is higher. In contrast, when the rate is prominent in players’ minds (e.g., the rate is mentioned and no additional information indicates that players already have sufficient game currency, and thus it is irrelevant), players consider a virtual item as cheaper if the rate is higher. In the latter case, higher rate leads to stronger purchase intention of nonsocial, but not social, virtual items. Our findings show currency system design can affect players’ willingness to spend on virtual items thus affecting the revenue of game operators. Moreover, reminders of the actual monetary value of virtual items might help to reduce players’ overspending driven by the biasing effect of the game currency exchange rate.},

   abstract                      = {Online commerce websites often request users to register in the online shopping process. Recognizing the challenges of user registration, many websites opt to delay their registration request until the end of the conversion funnel (i.e., ex post registration request). A new study in Information Systems Research explores an alternative approach by asking users to register with the website at the beginning of their shopping journey (i.e., ex ante registration request). The authors of the study, Ni Huang (University of Houston), Probal Mojumder (University of Southern California), Tianshu Sun (University of Southern California), Jinchi Lv (University of Southern California), and Joseph M. Golden (Collage.com), show that the ex ante request leads to an increased probability of user registration. Furthermore, the ex ante request leads to considerable increases in customer purchases in the long run and does not significantly influence sales in the short run. Further investigation into the long-term and short-term effects provides suggestive evidence on several potential mechanisms, such as firm-initiated interaction (e.g., email marketing campaigns) and screening of low-interest users (i.e., users with low initial valuations of the website and in a potentially disengaged state). This study provides managerial implications on the design of user-registration systems in e-commerce websites.},

   abstract                      = {Massive online open courses (MOOCs) are a booming phenomenon in the digital era. However, the online nature of educational delivery via MOOCs creates every opportunity for digital distraction and procrastination, resulting in difficulties for students and instructors. According to a new study in Information Systems Research, the authors Ni Huang (University of Houston), Jiayin Zhang (Tsinghua University), Gordon Burtch (University of Minnesota), Xitong Li (HEC Paris), and Peiyu Chen (Arizona State University) report a randomized field experiment on a large MOOC platform to examine several calls to action (CTAs) pertaining to the completion and submission of course assignments with an eye toward combating student procrastination on MOOCs. Their results show that descriptive norms (i.e., informing the completion rates of the assignments) lead to higher probabilities of assignment completion and a shorter time to completion. In contrast, a deadline reminder in the form of a planning prompt (i.e., informing the target deadline for assignment submission and the importance of planning ahead) has a surprisingly counterproductive effect, in particular, if students’ active course load is low. One possible explanation is that the students with low course loads may perceive the deadline to be distant, which reduces their sense of urgency and leads to complacency.},

In this paper, augmented intelligence informally means computers and humans working together, by design, to enhance one another, such that the intelligence of the resulting system improves. Intelligence augmentation (IA) can pool the joint intelligence of humans and computers to transform individual work, organizations, and society. Notably, applications of IA are beginning to emerge in several domains, such as cybersecurity, privacy, counterterrorism, and healthcare, among others. We provide a brief summary of papers in this special section that represent early attempts to address some of the rapidly emerging research issues. We also present a framework to guide research on IA and advocate for the important implications of IA for the future of work, organizations, and society. We conclude by outlining promising research directions based on this framework for the information systems and related disciplines.},

   abstract                      = {Privacy is of prime importance to many individuals when they attempt to develop online social relationships. Nonetheless, it has been observed that individuals' behavior is at times inconsistent with their privacy concerns, e.g., they disclose substantial private information in synchronous online social interactions, even though they are aware of the risks involved. Drawing on the hyperpersonal framework and the privacy calculus perspective, this paper elucidates the interesting roles of privacy concerns and social rewards in synchronous online social interactions by examining the causes and the behavioral strategies that individuals utilize to protect their privacy. An empirical study involving 251 respondents was conducted in online chat rooms. Our results indicate that individuals utilize both self-disclosure and misrepresentation to protect their privacy and that social rewards help explain why individuals may not behave in accordance with their privacy concerns. In addition, we find that perceived anonymity of others and perceived intrusiveness affect both privacy concerns and social rewards. Our findings also suggest that higher perceived anonymity of self decreases individuals' privacy concerns, and higher perceived media richness increases social rewards. Generally, this study contributes to the information systems literature by integrating the hyperpersonal framework and the privacy calculus perspective to identify antecedents of privacy trade-off and predict individuals' behavior in synchronous online social interactions.},

   abstract                      = {Lending-based real estate crowdfunding, which involves the use of real estate to secure loans, has emerged as a promising alternative with lower risk than peer-to-peer lending. This study provides insights into understanding how lenders’ investment behavior is shaped by various information in such an emerging market. Using a data set from a large platform over 17 months, the authors find that lenders as a whole prefer loans secured by a borrower’s house to those secured by a mortgage, as reflected in quicker and larger lending transactions. Experienced lenders tend to invest more aggressively, in both time and amount, but exhibit a weaker preference for loans secured by a borrower’s house. A rise in housing prices is associated with quicker lending decisions, and this association is found to be stronger for loans secured by a borrower’s house. When stock market volatility is large, lenders tend to slow down their investments; such a tendency is attenuated for loans secured by a mortgage. The authors suggest that lender heterogeneity in responding to different collateral types should be incorporated into the platform’s design of an automatic transaction or a recommender system. Moreover, platform managers should consider economic conditions at the macro level when deploying their marketing strategy.},

   abstract                      = {Crowdsourcing is a new way for online crowds to get involved in a company’s research and development process. Businesses can host public contests on online platforms (such as Kaggle, Topcoder, and Tongal) to seek new product ideas and technological solutions. In the contest communities, members usually have a “coopetitive” relationship: they compete against each other for the contest prize, while at the same time also cooperate with each other by sharing information and knowledge. This work investigates the effect of knowledge sharing in such crowdsourcing contests. Surprisingly, we find that the knowledge sharing process may not always help improve crowdsourcing contestants’ performance. The effectiveness of knowledge sharing is influenced by the volume, quality, and generativity of shared knowledge. Shared knowledge is only beneficial when it is of high quality or when it has high potential of being further developed collectively by the community. Meanwhile, the development process has to be diverging; narrowing the development process in one direction can restrict the community creativity and negatively influence crowdsourcing performance. Our work informs the crowdsourcing practitioners to be more cautious when they enable collaboration such as knowledge sharing for the contest community.},

   abstract                      = {Systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly support physicians in diagnostic decisions, but they are not without errors and biases. Failure to detect those may result in wrong diagnoses and medical errors. Compared with rule-based systems, however, these systems are less transparent and their errors less predictable. Thus, it is difficult, yet critical, for physicians to carefully evaluate AI advice. This study uncovers the cognitive challenges that medical decision makers face when they receive potentially incorrect advice from AI-based diagnosis systems and must decide whether to follow or reject it. In experiments with 68 novice and 12 experienced physicians, novice physicians with and without clinical experience as well as experienced radiologists made more inaccurate diagnosis decisions when provided with incorrect AI advice than without advice at all. We elicit five decision-making patterns and show that wrong diagnostic decisions often result from shortcomings in utilizing metacognitions related to decision makers’ own reasoning (self-monitoring) and metacognitions related to the AI-based system (system monitoring). As a result, physicians fall for decisions based on beliefs rather than actual data or engage in unsuitably superficial evaluation of the AI advice. Our study has implications for the training of physicians and spotlights the crucial role of human actors in compensating for AI errors.},

The development of user competence to effectively use a complex system is socially constructed. Based on the job demands-resources model, we propose and empirically validate how two types of work contextual factors, namely, job demands and job resources, are directly and interactively related to user competence. Results of a longitudinal survey from users in six organizations suggest that all three job resource factors considered—leader–member exchange, traditional support structures, and peer support structure—allow users to acquire both the technical and business knowledge needed for effective application of the system for work. But, work overload, as the job demand factor, has no significant effect on user competence. Further analysis shows the relationship between work overload and user competence is moderated by leader–member exchange, but not the two support structures. Our findings are of great importance for practice, as they suggest job resources are conducive to the development of user competence, whereas work overload is an inevitable, acute problem.},

   abstract                      = {Online reviews are a crucial source of information for consumer decision making. Many businesses, companies, and platforms are interested in encouraging more consumers to review their products but are dubious about using financial incentives to buy online reviews. Our research describes a social way of growing online reviews. We show that cultivating an online community for reviewing by showing members reviews written by their online friends cannot only increasing their willingness to contribute but also the quality of the resulting reviews. The takeaways of this study include (1) unlike using financial rewards to incentivize review contribution, the studied approach can motivate review contributions without compromising the quality of reviews contributed; (2) the effect of exposing consumers to their friends’ reviews is comparable to that of Yelp’s weekly newsletters (thus this can be a powerful way of motivating consumer reviews); and (3) to effectively leverage friend reviews, online platforms should facilitate social networking among users and build an online community that recognizes and rewards members who make frequent, high-quality contributions to online reviews.},

   abstract                      = {This issue marks the end of the third and last year of my term as Editor-in-Chief of ISR. Three years ago I wrote an editorial for the first issue that set the tone and immediate goals for the journal, summarized as follows: “ISR has established itself as one of a small set of top-tier academic journals in the information systems discipline. Editorial policy changes have been designed to strengthen a number of aspects of the journal, particularly the timeliness of the work published, without having a negative impact on the journal's reputation for publishing high-quality work” (ISR website 2002). Looking back at the past three years, these goals have been met—we have decreased turnaround time by more than 50%, and the journal's ratings are as strong as (or stronger than) they were before. In this editorial note I will highlight our current processes and provide some data regarding the journal's progress over the last three years.},

   abstract                      = {The video game industry has a robust secondhand market for games, even though some of the major gaming-console companies possess the means to shut it down. What is the special ingredient in this industry that would incentivize a manufacturer to give tacit approval to buying and selling used games? In this study, leveraging a game-theoretic model, we investigate the effect of gaming console on a manufacturer’s strategy in the presence of a secondhand market for games. We find that when the manufacturer offers a console that provides additional value outside of playing games (e.g., media hub with apps), the secondhand market improves the manufacturer’s profit, consumer surplus, and social welfare, all at the same time. Moreover, the manufacturer enjoys greater benefit from the secondhand market as the intrinsic value of the console increases. This is in stark contrast with cases where there are no consoles involved or the consoles do not offer any intrinsic value; in such settings, the manufacturer would opt to shut down the secondhand market. Overall, our results have implications that apply not only to the past and present of the gaming industry but also to its future and to other types of platform-based markets for contents.},

   abstract                      = {In today's competitive environment, an increasing number of firms are building common information systems, which will be deployed globally, to support their strategic globalization initiatives. These systems are designed to meet the requirements of a diverse set of stakeholders with different business needs, priorities, and objectives. One managerial tool for addressing and reconciling such differences is control, which encompasses all attempts to motivate individuals to act in a manner that is consistent with organizational objectives. This paper examines two research questions. How do stakeholders exercise control during different phases of large IS projects? Why do control choices change across project phases? Results of two case studies suggest control is exercised differently for each phase. During the initial phase of a project, control is exercised as “collective sensemaking,” in which both IS and business stakeholders utilize mostly informal mechanisms of control. During development, “technical winnowing” of mechanisms occurs such that control is vested primarily in IS managers, who structure hierarchical relationships with subordinates and who rely extensively on formal control mechanisms. Both IS and business stakeholders employ formal and informal mechanisms during implementation to exercise control as “collaborative coordinating.” The results also suggest that changes in control choices from one project phase to another are triggered by factors in the project, stakeholder, and global contexts. As factors change across phases, so too do control choices. Further, problems that surface in one project phase trigger changes to controls in subsequent phases. These findings are integrated into a model of the dynamics of control. Implications of these results are drawn, and directions for future research are suggested.},

   abstract                      = {Information technology (IT) outsourcing success requires careful management of customer-supplier relationships. However, there are few published studies on the ongoing relationships, and most of these adopt a customer perspective, de-emphasizing suppliers. In this study, we look at both customer and supplier perspectives, by means of the psychological contract of customer and supplier project managers. We apply the concept of psychological contract to perceived mutual obligations, and to how such fulfillment of obligations can predict success. Our research questions are (1) What are the critical customer-supplier obligations in an IT outsourcing relationship? and (2) What is the impact of fulfilling these obligations on success? We use a sequential, qualitative-quantitative approach to develop and test our model. In the qualitative study, we probe the nature of customer-supplier obligations using in-depth interviews. Content analysis of interview transcripts show that both customers and suppliers identify six obligations that are critical to success. Customers perceive supplier obligations to be accurate project scoping, clear authority structures, taking charge, effective human capital management, effective knowledge transfer, and effective interorganizational teams. Suppliers perceive customer obligations as clear specifications, prompt payment, close project monitoring, dedicated project staffing, knowledge sharing, and project ownership. In the second quantitative study, we assess the impact of fulfilling these obligations on success through a field study of 370 managers. Results show that fulfilled obligations predict success over and above the effects of contract type, duration, and size.},

   abstract                      = {Current reputation systems in online (labor) markets are overly positive and unidimensional. This article presents a new reputation framework that combines human input with machine learning to provide dynamic, multidimensional, and skill-set-specific quality assessments. The framework significantly outperforms current reputation systems. By providing more representative reputation scores, the framework helps workers to differentiate, employers to make informed decisions, and the market to improve its recommendation algorithms and understand the supply distributions across different dimensions. The framework generalizes in other contexts where reputation systems are overly positive and unidimensional. The framework highlights how combining human input with advanced machine learning techniques can augment intelligence by creating the necessary conditions for humans to make informed decisions. Such systems have the potential to increase efficiency and outcome quality precisely because they intelligently differentiate workers. The deployment of the proposed intelligence augmentation framework in different types of online platforms could have implications for workers, employers, businesses, and the future of work.},

In practice, however, the vast majority of a community’s users (∼90%) remain inactive (lurk), simply observing contributions made by intermittent (∼9%) and heavy (∼1%) contributors. Our research examines increases and decreases of types of user engagement in online communities, characterizing user engagement based on trace user activity or lack of activity. Some lurkers later become workers (i.e., engaged in the community), but some will not. Differentiating lurkers who can be engaged from those who cannot enables managers to anticipate and proactively direct their resources toward the users who are most likely to become or remain workers (i.e., heavy contributors), thereby promoting community welfare. Our research, based on analysis of 533,714 posts from an online diabetes community, can thus guide managerial interventions to increase online community welfare.},

To do so, we study two events that removed and then partially restored access to online music videos for consumers in Germany. Because of a legal dispute, virtually all music videos were blocked from YouTube, which led to a decrease in record sales of about 5%–10%. When the dedicated platform Vevo entered a few years later, record sales increased again by a similar amount. This is effect can be attributed to user-generated content (fan videos and cover versions) as much as to official music videos. Record sales of newcomer artists and mainstream music benefit disproportionally. We discuss the implications for debates on the reform of compulsory licensing rules and copyright.},

   abstract                      = {To inform product release and distribution strategies, research has analyzed cross-market spillovers in new product adoption. However, models that examine these effects for digital and viral media are still evolving. Given resistance to advertising, firms often seek to promote their own viral content to boost brand awareness. However, a key shortcoming of virality is its ephemeral nature. To gain insight into sustaining virality, we develop a quasi-experimental approach that estimates the backward spillover onto a focal platform by introducing a piece of content onto a new platform. We posit that introducing content to the audience of a new platform can generate word of mouth, which may affect its consumption within an earlier platform. We estimate these spillovers using data on 381 viral videos on 26 platforms (e.g., YouTube, Vimeo) and observe how consumption of videos on an initial “lead” platform is affected by their subsequent introduction onto “lag” platforms. This spillover is estimated as follows: for each multiplatform video, we compare its view growth after being introduced onto a new platform to that of a synthetic control based on similar single-platform videos. Analysis of 275 such spillover scenarios reveals that introducing a video onto a lag platform roughly doubles its subsequent view growth in the lead platform. This positive cross-platform spillover is persistent, bursty, and strongest in the first 42 days. We find that spillover is boosted when the video is consumed more in the lag platform, when the consumption rate peaks earlier in the lag platform, and when the lag platform targets a foreign market. Our findings suggest that firms can sustain the popularity of their viral content by introducing it onto additional platforms (e.g., Vimeo) after posting it on a focal platform (e.g., YouTube). As a result of their posting on the latter platforms, firms can expect subsequent view growth on the focal platform to roughly double. The aforementioned benefits persists for up to five lag platforms. Platforms should also consider that a positive cross-platform spillover may help platforms reinforce each other’s usage, rather than cannibalize each other.},

   abstract                      = {Digital advertisements offer a full spectrum of behavioral customization for timing and content capabilities. The existing research in display advertising has predominantly concentrated on the content of advertising; however, our focus is on optimizing the timing of display advertising. In practice, users are constantly adjusting their engagement with content as they process new information continuously. The recent development of emotional tracking and wearable technologies allows platforms to monitor the user’s engagement in real time. The proposed optimal policy regarding the timing of behavioral advertising is based on a threshold policy with a trigger threshold and target level. Analogous to the familiar idea of “price discrimination,” the methods we propose in this study allow the platforms to maximize their revenue by “discriminatory” customization of the timing and length of the advertisement based on the behavior of individual users. Finally, we quantify the benefits of the proposed policy by comparing it with the practically prevalent policies (i.e., preroll, midroll, and a mix of the two) through a simulation study. Our results reveal that, for a wide range of settings, the proposed policy not only significantly increases the platform’s profitability but also improves the completion rate at which consumers finish viewing the advertisement.},

However, whereas the resulting loss of jobs has been shown to have many negative consequences for the affected individuals, it may also push them into new activities, such as provision of service to their communities. In this paper, we show how individuals engage in socially useful activities after an increase in unemployment. Specifically, we document increased online content generation at Wikipedia, the world’s largest user-generated knowledge repository. Leveraging German district-level and European country-level unemployment data, we analyze the relationship between the economic crisis in 2008–2010 and contributions to Wikipedia. We find increased socially valuable activity in the form of knowledge acquisition and contributions to Wikipedia. For German districts, we observe an increase in the rate of content generation on Wikipedia in more severely affected districts. These effects are even stronger at the European country level. Our findings suggest that public goods provision increases as a positive side effect of economic crises. We stress that similar patterns could apply to other digital content platforms. Under the backdrop that the potential value of the outcome of online volunteering and its societal impact is expected to grow drastically in the next years, we show that platforms could benefit from negative economic conditions in attracting volunteers. Moreover, in the coming years, the rapid development of artificial intelligence will call for a rise of online volunteering platforms. Therefore, the potential value of the outcome of online volunteering and its societal impact is expected to grow drastically in the next years.},

   abstract                      = {We study the spillover effects of the online reviews of other covisited products on the purchases of a focal product using clickstream data from a large retailer. The proposed spillover effects are moderated by (a) whether the related (covisited) products are complementary or substitutive, (b) the choice of media channel (mobile or personal computer (PC)) used, (c) whether the related products are from the same or a different brand, (d) consumer experience, and (e) the variance of the review ratings. To identify complementary and substitutive products, we develop supervised machine-learning models based on product characteristics, such as product category and brand, and novel text-based similarity measures. We train and validate the machine-learning models using product pair labels from Amazon Mechanical Turk. Our results show that the mean rating of substitutive (complementary) products has a negative (positive) effect on purchasing of the focal product. Interestingly, the magnitude of the spillover effects of the mean ratings of covisited (substitutive and complementary) products is significantly larger than the effects on the focal product, especially for complementary products. The spillover effect of ratings is stronger for consumers who use mobile devices versus PCs. We find the negative effect of the mean ratings of substitutive products across different brands on purchasing of a focal product to be significantly higher than within the same brand. Lastly, the effect of the mean ratings is stronger for less experienced consumers and for ratings with lower variance. We discuss implications on leveraging the spillover effect of the online product reviews of related products to encourage online purchases.},

   abstract                      = {Is there a gender bias in promotions at information technology (IT) companies? Do women get an equal lift in their promotion prospects from performance improvements, work experience, and training as men? These are pertinent and important questions affecting today’s IT human capital. We analyze data from a leading IT services firm using robust econometric techniques to suggest that, contrary to expectations, women are more likely to be promoted. Although we do not find any evidence of overt discrimination, our findings, however, are far more nuanced and imply that there may be covert discrimination against women in IT when it comes to promotions: compared with men, women realize less benefit from performance gains than men, less benefit from tenure within the focal firm, but more benefit from training. Although our analysis is limited to the lower rungs of the organizational hierarchy, we propose several actionable managerial and policy insights that can potentially make IT firms more inclusive and attractive to women: more parity in the effect of performance improvements and work experience on promotions and using training as a signaling mechanism that can identify and encourage stellar women as they navigate the promotional ladder in IT firms.},

   abstract                      = {Prior research on online reviews has taken for granted that consumers submit reviews only after they have fully consumed purchased products or services. Contrastingly, this study uncovered the hidden truth that many book consumers post assessments before, during, and after consumption. Interestingly, many provide numerical review ratings, even with no consumption at all. We also found that review comments formed after incomplete product engagement adversely affect subsequent sales. Consequently, online evaluations crafted on the basis of fragmentary encounters can become a new source of challenges to managers and policymakers who are responsible for preserving the accuracy and informativeness of product critiques. Digital platforms may leverage our findings to improve their design of review systems and policies in ways that enhance the trustworthiness of peer evaluations and correct potential inaccuracies from inadequately informed assessments. For example, managers can revise their review “sorting” structure so that consumers can flexibly reposition text-based reviews in accordance with a consumption index. Managers can likewise take advantage of these study’s insights to effectively re-establish review-posting policies and schemes that encourage consumers to submit reviews after a sufficient amount of products have been consumed.},

   abstract                      = {As the mobile app market grows rapidly, with millions of apps and billions of users, search costs are increasing tremendously. Similar to the case of recommender systems, the challenge is how apps can be recommended to the right users and how consumers can find the right apps. This paper studies a new mobile app ad framework, cross-promotion (CP), which is to promote new “target” apps within other “source” apps. With unique random matching experiment data, we empirically test the important determinants of ad effectiveness. We then propose a machine-learning-based framework to optimally match source apps to target apps to improve ad effectiveness in terms of app downloads and postdownload usages. The simulation results show that app analytics capability is essential in building accurate prediction models and in increasing ad effectiveness of CP campaigns and that, at the expense of privacy, individual user data can further improve the matching performance. The paper has important managerial implications because it provides direct guidance to better utilize CP for app developers and to leverage data analytics and machine-learning models for platform managers. It also provides policy implications on the trade-off between utility and privacy in the growing data economy.},

   abstract                      = {Axiomatic Theories and Improving the Relevance of Information Systems Research This paper examines the fact that a significant number of empirical information systems (IS) studies engage in confirmative testing of self-evident axiomatic theories without yielding highly relevant knowledge for the IS community. The authors conduct both a horizontal analysis of 72 representative IS theories and an in-depth vertical analysis of 3 well-known theories (i.e., technology acceptance model, diffusion of innovation theory, and institutional theory) in order to measure how pervasive such testing of axiomatic theories is. The authors discovered that more than 60% of 666 hypotheses from the horizontal analysis could be regarded as axiomatic theory elements. In the vertical analysis, 68.1% of 1,301 hypotheses from 148 articles were axiomatic. Based on these findings, the authors propose four complementary IS research approaches: (1) identifying disconfirming boundary conditions, (2) measuring the relative importance of axiomatic causal factors, (3) measuring the stage of progression toward visionary goals when the nature of the axiomatic theory can be extended to future visions, and (4) engaging in the conceptual design of visionary axiomatic goals. They argue that these complementary IS research approaches can enhance the relevance of IS research outcomes without sacrificing methodological rigor.},

   abstract                      = {When reviewers write online reviews, they differ in the focus of their attention: some focus on their own experiences, whereas some direct their attention to others—prospective consumers who may read the reviews in the future. This paper explores how, why, and when reviewers’ attentional focus can influence the helpfulness evaluation of reviews beyond the impact of substantive review content. Drawing on the attentional focus and persuasion literatures, we develop a theoretical model proposing that reviewers’ attentional focus may influence consumers’ perception of review helpfulness through opposing processes, and that its overall effect is contingent on the review’s two-sidedness. Results of one archival analysis and five controlled experiments provide consistent support for our hypotheses. This work challenges the predominant view of the positive impact of other-focus (vs. self-focus), explores the interpersonal impact of a reviewer’s attentional focus on prospective consumers who are total strangers, and reveals an important, context-specific boundary condition.},

   abstract                      = {In this paper, we propose a two-step data-analytic approach to the promotion planning for mobile applications (apps). In the first step, we use historical sales data to estimate the app demand model and quantify the effect of price promotions on download volume. The estimation results reveal two interesting characteristics of the relationship between price promotion and download volume of mobile apps: (1) the magnitude of the direct immediate promotion effect is declining within a multiday promotion; and (2) due to the visibility effect (i.e., apps ranked high on the download chart are more visible to consumers), a price promotion also has an indirect effect on download volume by affecting app rank, and this effect can persist after the promotion ends. Based on the empirically estimated demand model, we propose a moving planning window heuristic to construct a promotion policy. Our heuristic promotion policy consists of shorter and more frequent promotions. We show that the proposed policy can increase the app lifetime revenue by around 10%.},

   abstract                      = {The eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) can standardize numerical disclosures and make it easier for computers to process and compare financial reports. This perceived benefit of XBRL has prompted the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to mandate that public firms must submit financial statements in the XBRL format as part of their financial reports. Leveraging the research opportunity created by the XBRL mandate, we examine whether financial reporting technologies affect how firms construct textual disclosures. We find that the initial adopters’ HTML-formatted annual reports become harder to read after the XBRL mandate. Further analysis reveals that this effect is concentrated among adopters with more quantitative disclosures, a smaller firm size, or a higher level of financial complexity. Importantly, we show that managers’ reduced attention to preparing HTML-formatted annual reports, rather than increased disclosures, is likely the explanation for this decrease in textual readability. We also find that the negative effect on textual readability persists at least in the subsequent year. Our findings suggest that the XBRL adopters need to pay attention to process optimization and technology enablement to mitigate the possible negative effect of XBRL adoption on the readability of financial reports.},

   abstract                      = {Many platforms use monetary incentives to encourage user-generated content (UGC) contributions. The empirical evidence, however, is contradictory: monetary incentives are shown to either increase or decrease contribution. We make the first attempt to build a unified theoretical model to understand the complex nature of the impact of monetary incentives. We consider contributors differentiated not only by their attitudes toward monetary incentives but also by their effectiveness to attract audience. We identify two scenarios where contributors can be crowded out when monetary incentives are present: (1) when a small amount of monetary incentive is introduced, the non–money-driven contributors reduce or even stop contributing (motivation crowding out); or (2) when the monetary incentive is relatively large, the high-effectiveness contributors crowd out the low-effectiveness ones (competition crowding out). As a result, an increase in the monetary incentive can either increase or decrease contributors’ participation and the total content volume contributed. Our results offer guidelines for different UGC platforms to design monetary incentive mechanisms.},

Based on our analysis, we would recommend that e-retailing firms choose the flexible contracts, which give them the flexibility of adjusting their advertising spending during the advertising campaign and make them better off. We also send a clear message to e-retailers that their leverage of engaging in flexible competition is contingent on the size of their operational costs. In particular, as operational costs decrease, they should be more mindful of engaging in the flexible competition. However, from the standpoint of advertising agents (e.g., Facebook.com ), because firms’ advertising efforts are lower in flexible than committed competition, we would recommend that the advertising agents adopt differential pricing schemes under the two modes of competition. In particular, the agents need to offer discounts to the e-retailers signing flexible advertising contracts so as to step up the advertising competition. In addition, our findings also provide the advertising agents with guidance on how to determine the optimal value for the discounts to be offered.},

   abstract                      = {Human capital is a key component of the knowledge economy. Firms compete not only for consumers in the product market but also for human capital in the labor market. In this study, we perform an interfirm labor market competitor analysis using the online profiles of more than 89,000 employees and their career histories that span more than 3,000 public firms. Using these profiles, we characterize firms through the granular skill distribution of their employees. Also, using employee migrations across firms, we derive and analyze a human capital flow (HCF) network. Such information allows us to measure the interfirm human capital overlap in terms of similarity in their employees’ skills and HCF network structure. We show that our proposed human capital overlap metrics have superior predictive power over conventional firm-level measures in predicting future labor market competitors. We further demonstrate how our proposed metrics and the prediction framework can be incorporated into a comprehensive two-dimensional competitor analysis that includes both product and labor overlap between firms. By evaluating interfirm relationships in the product and labor markets simultaneously, this two-dimensional competitor analysis framework can help managers make strategic decisions beyond human resources, such as product development and customer relationship management.},

Despite the importance of understanding the nature of online consumers' concerns for information privacy, this topic has received little attention in the information systems community. To fill the gap in the literature, this article focuses on three distinct, yet closely related, issues. First, drawing on social contract theory, we offer a theoretical framework on the dimensionality of Internet users' information privacy concerns (IUIPC). Second, we attempt to operationalize the multidimensional notion of IUIPC using a second-order construct, and we develop a scale for it. Third, we propose and test a causal model on the relationship between IUIPC and behavioral intention toward releasing personal information at the request of a marketer. We conducted two separate field surveys and collected data from 742 household respondents in one-on-one, face-to-face interviews. The results of this study indicate that the second-order IUIPC factor, which consists of three first-order dimensions—namely, collection, control, and awareness—exhibited desirable psychometric properties in the context of online privacy. In addition, we found that the causal model centering on IUIPC fits the data satisfactorily and explains a large amount of variance in behavioral intention, suggesting that the proposed model will serve as a useful tool for analyzing online consumers' reactions to various privacy threats on the Internet.},

   abstract                      = {With human brands or individual celebrities in fields ranging from sports to politics increasingly using social media platforms to engage with their audience, it is important to understand the key drivers of online engagement. Using Twitter data from the political domain, we show that positive and negative-toned content receive higher engagement, as measured by retweets, than mixed or neutral toned tweets. However, less popular human brands generate higher social media engagement from positive-toned content compared with more popular human brands. Therefore, we recommend that popular human brands (e.g., popular politicians or chief executive officers) keep their content objective rather than emotional. Furthermore, the tone of related brands (i.e., human brands who belong to the same political party) has a strong reinforcement effect; that is, social media engagement is higher when the tone of the focal human brand and related brands are the same and lower when the tones are different. Therefore, we prescribe that human brands actively coordinate their social media content with related brands to generate higher engagement. From human brands’ perspective, our findings recommend a comprehensive social media strategy, which takes into account the tone of content, tone of related brands’ content, and human brands’ popularity.},

   abstract                      = {The wide variety of pricing policies used in practice by data sellers suggests that there are significant challenges in pricing data sets. In this paper, we develop a utility framework that is appropriate for data buyers and the corresponding pricing of the data by the data seller. Buyers interested in purchasing a data set have private valuations in two aspects—their ideal record that they value the most, and the rate at which their valuation for the records in the data set decays as they differ from the buyers’ ideal record. The seller allows individual buyers to filter the data set and select the records that are of interest to them. The multidimensional private information of the buyers coupled with the endogenous selection of records makes the seller’s problem of optimally pricing the data set a challenging one. We formulate a tractable model and successfully exploit its special structure to obtain optimal and near-optimal data-selling mechanisms. Specifically, we provide insights into the conditions under which a commonly used mechanism—namely, a price-quantity schedule—is optimal for the data seller. When the conditions leading to the optimality of a price-quantity schedule do not hold, we show that the optimal price-quantity schedule offers an attractive worst-case guarantee relative to an optimal mechanism. Further, we numerically solve for the optimal mechanism and show that the actual performance of two simple and well-known price-quantity schedules—namely, two-part tariff and two-block tariff—is near optimal. We also quantify the value to the seller from allowing buyers to filter the data set.},

   abstract                      = {Daily deal platforms, such as Groupon, peaked in the mid-2000s, by letting retailers offer 50% promotions to consumers using an app. When used right, retailers were able to get consumers to try them for the first time and build a customer base. When used wrong, retailers lost revenue unnecessarily and sometimes went out of business. Even now, in 2020, you can find lovers and haters of daily deals, and yet they remain an integral part of the marketing mix for many retailers. One lingering question about these deals remained: How do customers perceive a retailer that offers daily deals before going to the retailer? Do retailers look desperate or confident? Through a series of laboratory experiments, we test whether offering a deal changes consumers’ preconsumption brand evaluations. Our research shows that brand evaluations are contingent on the retailer type (i.e., price segment and age), the success of the current deals offered (i.e., number of page visits and purchases), and the number of competitors that are also using deals. Together, our work demonstrates specific conditions where offering deals may lead to positive or negative consumer perceptions even before arriving at the retailer.},

   abstract                      = {Providers of free-to-play games often gain revenue by monetizing players’ playtime, for example, through in-game advertising and by selling premium modules of the game. One emerging strategy to sell the premium module, known as the virtual selling strategy, is to set the module price based on an amount of virtual currency that players can either spend on playtime to earn or use real currency to buy. In this paper, we examine how the virtual selling strategy leads to different market outcomes than the traditional real selling strategy where players can purchase the premium module using real currency only. We focus on the differences caused by one specific feature—players can pay for the module indirectly using their playtime in the virtual selling strategy. We show that when the provider’s efficiency of monetizing players’ playtime, that is, the time revenue rate, is above a threshold, the virtual selling strategy will benefit the provider and hurt the overall consumer surplus compared with the real selling strategy, even though players in the virtual selling strategy have one additional way, that is, using their playtime, to pay for the module. We identify an undocumented overcompensation effect that causes the profit augmentation and the surplus reduction. The overcompensation effect also results in a U-shaped relationship between the equilibrium module price and the time revenue rate in the virtual selling strategy when the module only provides a small number of new gaming stages. It contradicts the traditional result from the real selling strategy that the provider shall reduce the module price when she becomes more efficient in monetizing players’ playtime.},

   abstract                      = {Disinformation on social media—commonly called “fake news”—has become a major concern around the world, and many fact-checking initiatives have been launched in response. However, if the presentation format of fact-checked results is not persuasive, fact-checking may not be effective. For instance, Facebook tested the idea of flagging dubious articles in 2017 but concluded that it was ineffective and removed the feature. We conducted three experiments with social media users to investigate two different approaches to implementing a fake news flag—one designed to be most effective when processed by automatic cognition (System 1) and the other designed to be most effective when processed by deliberate cognition (System 2). Both interventions were effective, and an intervention that combined both approaches was about twice as effective. The awareness training on the meaning of the flags increased the effectiveness of the System 2 intervention but not the System 1 intervention. Believability influenced the extent to which users would engage with the article (e.g., read, like, comment, and share). Our results suggest that both theoretical routes can be used—separately or together—in the presentation of fact-checking results in order to reduce the influence of fake news on social media users.},

   abstract                      = {What people perceive when they interact with technologies are not the features and functionalities of the technology but rather the behaviors it affords them. Affordance perception determines how organizational information technology (IT) is used by employees and the benefits they provide to organizations and their members. In this article, we explain how employees who pursue different personal goals and use various learning strategies come to perceive different IT affordances. We identify three distinct pathways: (1) performance-avoidance goals are positively associated with surface processing, which leads to perceptions of common in-role IT affordances; (2) performance-approach goals are positively associated with surface processing and effort regulation and these learning strategies lead to perceptions of common and specialized in-role IT affordances; and (3) mastery goals are associated with deep processing, effort regulation, and peer learning, which are positively associated with perceptions of specialized in-role and extra-role IT affordances. By identifying the different pathways to perceived affordances, the article identifies potential interventions that can help managers steer employees toward certain affordances and away from other, less desirable affordances.},

Trade commissions and even supreme courts recognize the need for economic analysis as the nature of competition changes in the market. There have been many mergers and acquisitions across platform-based businesses. In the ride-sharing sector, Lyft and Didi Chuxing were initially in a partnership to thwart Uber but Uber merged its operation with Didi Chuxing eventually. Amazon and Walmart competed fiercely to buy the Indian online retailer Flipkart, which Walmart eventually won. Traditional antitrust models studying the implications of mergers do not consider the underlying network structure of these intermediary markets. This is the main focus of our model and analysis. We provide a network measurement to evaluate the effect of mergers on welfare. Our analysis shows that because of the underlying networks mergers can sometimes improve welfare.},

   abstract                      = {In this paper, we exploit a large-scale TV program, the Super Bowl 2016, to investigate the impact of television program–induced emotions on viewers’ online word-of-mouth (WOM) behavior on Twitter toward the Super Bowl ads aired during the game. The results obtained from a difference-in-differences analysis support our hypotheses on the direct and congruence effects of television program–induced emotions. Findings on the direct effect suggest that television program–induced emotional shocks (e.g., frustration after a fumble or joyness after a touchdown) have a significant effect on the arousal and valence of viewers’ online WOM toward ads subsequently. We additionally find that a match between television program–induced emotional shocks and the emotional content of ads leads to a more significant increase in the arousal and more favorable valence of online WOM responses to ads subsequently. Our findings suggest that advertisers should pay attention to the emotional context of ads in which the ads are placed and the content of ads. It would be more optimal to allocate ads into different programs or different positions in a certain program such that the context of ads and the content of ads are carefully matched or contrasted, especially when ads are likely to stimulate positive feedback from the audience.},

   abstract                      = {Augmented reality (AR)–based applications have been growing in prominence. Pokémon Go, one of the most popular AR game applications, has been engaging in strategic partnership with businesses. The game combines geospatial elements with gamification practices to incentivize user movement in the physical world. In this study, we examine the value of such strategic partnerships between Pokémon Go and associated businesses. Specifically, we use data of the online reviews for a firm to study consumer engagement and consumer perception after the release of the game on its associated businesses. We find that restaurants associated with Pokémon Go do indeed enjoy a higher level of consumer engagement and more positive consumer perception. We also find that characteristics of the business significantly moderate this impact overall. Using a parsimonious analytical model, we also demonstrate the mechanism behind these results. Our study provides insights into consumer economic behavior in the context of AR applications. We further inform the business owners and policymakers regarding the potential value of such strategic business partnerships with such applications.},

Our analysis shows that transactions in the mobile channel are more concentrated on “head” products compared with PC channel sales. However, it does not imply that the presence of the mobile channel concentrates the demand on head products in online markets, given that mobile channel users can purchase products in the PC channel as well. On the basis of the subsequent user-level analysis, we reveal that in the case of preference goods such as books, CDs, toys, and fashion items, mobile commerce channel adoption increased e-market users’ search activities and resulted in more “tail” product sales. For quality goods such as PCs, phones, cameras, and digital appliances, however, adoption intensified the search activities but resulted in more head product sales. Finally, for convenience goods such as home supplies and processed foods, adoption discouraged search activities and decreased the choice of tail products.},

   abstract                      = {Organizational ambidexterity refers to the capability of businesses to balance the pursuit of radical innovation simultaneously with incremental innovation. It echoes the popular notion that to thrive well in a competitive economy, businesses need to balance their exploration of new markets and products with exploitation or balance operational efficiency with flexibility. Digital technologies have become central to enabling organizational ambidexterity. The analysis reveals how the three dimensions of digitization efforts—IT implementation spending, IT training, and actual IT usage—should be combined with specific internal and external factors to develop greater ambidexterity. Two of these complementary factors are either a centralized organizational structure or a strong supplier and partner network—the first a likely channel for cross-organizational knowledge transfer and the second for interfirm knowledge transfers. However, determining which combinations are useful also depends on the size of the business and competitiveness of markets. Large businesses, or those in more competitive sectors, derive a slightly greater advantage from digitization than small firms or those in less competitive sectors. These findings are useful for policy makers tasked with subsidy allocation to industry sectors and managers when allocating investment spending for digitization.},

   abstract                      = {How can we tailor assistance systems, such as recommender systems or decision support systems, to consumers’ individual shopping motives? How can companies unobtrusively identify shopping motives without explicit user input? We demonstrate that eye movement data allow building reliable prediction models for identifying goal-directed and exploratory shopping motives. Our approach is validated in a real supermarket and in an immersive virtual reality supermarket. Several managerial implications of using gaze-based classification of information search behavior are discussed: First, the advent of virtual shopping environments makes using our approach straightforward as eye movement data are readily available in next-generation virtual reality devices. Virtual environments can be adapted to individual needs once shopping motives are identified and can be used to generate more emotionally engaging customer experiences. Second, identifying exploratory behavior offers opportunities for marketers to adapt marketing communication and interaction processes. Personalizing the shopping experience and profiling customers’ needs based on eye movement data promises to further increase conversion rates and customer satisfaction. Third, eye movement-based recommender systems do not need to interrupt consumers and thus do not take away attention from the purchase process. Finally, our paper outlines the technological basis of our approach and discusses the practical relevance of individual predictors.},

   abstract                      = {How will disclosing users’ identities affect their content-generation activities? Will this identity-disclosure policy in one section also change users’ behaviors in the other section? We answer these questions by using a natural experiment where a large corporate online community chose to disclose users’ identities in one section (the focal section) but not the other (the neighbor section). Our analyses show that in the focal section, disclosing identity increases social presence and inhibits users’ willingness to generate content, resulting in greater effort spent per content but smaller content volume. Moreover, identity disclosure in the focal section has a strong displacement effect: users generate more pieces of content but decrease their effort per content in the neighbor section, where they remain anonymous. The intensity of these effects depends on users’ pursuit of volume- and effort-based image. For the managers of online communities, disclosing users’ identity information inevitably changes their content-generation activities, and the unintended displacement effect cannot be overlooked. Practitioners can adjust these effects by changing reward systems and how users earn image from content generation. Given that many websites rely on users’ voluntary content generation, the effects of relevant policies should be comprehensively evaluated.},

   abstract                      = {There is a surge of interest in social science studies in applying data mining methods to construct variables for regression analysis. For example, text classification was applied to classify whether the review is subjective or objective. The derived review subjectivity was used as an independent variable in the regression to examine its impact on review helpfulness. In the classification phase of these studies, researchers need to subjectively choose a classification performance metric for optimization. No matter which performance metric is chosen, the constructed variable still includes classification error because the variable cannot be classified perfectly. The misclassification of constructed variables will lead to inconsistent estimators of regression coefficients in the following phase. To correct the estimation inconsistency, we summarize and modify existing proofs in econometrics to derive theoretical formulas of consistent estimators in generalized linear models. The main implication of our theoretical result is that the inconsistency can be corrected by theoretical formulas, even when the classification accuracy is poor. Therefore, we propose that a classification algorithm should be tuned to minimize the standard error of the focal coefficient derived based on the corrected formula. As a result, researchers derive a consistent and most precise estimator in generalized linear models.},

The econometric analyses demonstrate a significant spillover effect, where product reviewers, after experiencing the receipt of financial incentives, tend to produce more positive but lower-quality unincentivized reviews subsequently. Theoretically, this paper advances our understanding of the interplay between financial incentives and prosocial behaviors through the lens of self-determination theory. Practically, this study provides insights into the design of online prosocial communities. Managers should not be enticed solely by an immediate increase in contribution quantity because the increased contribution volume might come at the cost of decreased quality in future unincentivized contributions. If platforms decide to provide financial incentives, they should target only altruistic contributors and limit the amount of incentives that an individual can receive. These findings provide important managerial implications for platforms hoping to motivate users’ prosocial contributions.},

Consumers shopping through social network channels are increasingly using this information in making their purchase decisions. We find that social ties impact the magnitude of observational learning. In the case of strangers, the effect of learning is stronger for vertically differentiated products than for horizontally differentiated products; whereas in the case of friends, the effect of learning for vertically differentiated products is similar to that for horizontally differentiated products. Moreover, the type of product impacts the magnitude of observational learning. For horizontally differentiated products, the effect of learning from friends is stronger than that from strangers; whereas for vertically differentiated products, the effect of learning from friends is similar to that from strangers. These findings provide motivation for online retailers to generate alternative strategies for increasing product sales through social networks. For example, online retailers offering horizontally differentiated products have strong incentives to cooperate with social media platforms (e.g., Instagram and Pinterest) in encouraging customers to share their purchase information.},

Activity-centric approaches to process modeling capture the mechanistic components of a process (including aspects of workflow, decision, and information), but agent-centric approaches capture specific aspects of the human component. In this paper, we explore an integrative viewpoint in which the transactional aspects of agent-centric concerns—for example, economic incentives for agents to perform—are integrated with decision and informational aspects of a process. To illustrate issues in this approach, we focus on modeling incentive mechanisms in a specific sales process and present results from an extensive simulation experiment. Our results highlight the importance of considering the effects of incentives when decision and informational aspects of a process undergo changes.},

   abstract                      = {Iterative combinatorial auctions are known to resolve bidder preference elicitation problems. However, winner determination is a known key bottleneck that has prevented widespread adoption of such auctions, and adding a time-bound to winner determination further complicates the mechanism. As a result, heuristic-based methods have enjoyed an increase in applicability. We add to the growing body of work in heuristic-based winner determination by proposing an ant colony metaheuristic–based anytime algorithm that produces optimal or near-optimal winner determination results within specified time. Our proposed algorithm resolves the speed versus accuracy problem and displays superior performance compared with 20 past state-of-the-art heuristics and two exact algorithms, for 94 open test auction instances that display a wide variety in bid-bundle composition. Furthermore, we contribute to the literature in two predominant ways: first, we represent the winner determination problem as one of finding the maximum weighted path on a directed cyclic graph; second, we improve upon existing ant colony heuristic–based exploration methods by implementing randomized pheromone updating and randomized graph pruning. Finally, to aid auction designers, we implement the anytime property of the algorithm, which allows auctioneers to stop the algorithm and return a valid solution to the winner determination problem even if it is interrupted before computation ends.},

   abstract                      = {In order to deliver real-time feedback to support employee development and rapid innovation, many companies are replacing formal review-based performance management with systems that enable frequent and continuous employee evaluation. Real-time feedback applications enable supervisors and employees to give, seek, and receive competency-based feedback using their computers, smartphones, or other devices. In this study, we examine the role of one such real-time feedback application to understand its effects on employee performance appraisals. First, we seek better understanding of how workplace relationships affect employee feedback across managers, colleagues, and direct reports and find that feedback tends to be more critical when given by managers. What is even more important from an industry perspective is the role of preferential treatment and retaliation. Managers can be more transactional, but colleagues are not. We also highlight a series of gender observations: men rate women higher than men, and women rate men and women similar to how men rate men. We conclude by finding that positive real-time feedback has a stronger effect on an employee’s future ratings than negative feedback. Our findings have direct implications for the design and implementation of performance management systems and highlight how companies can use information systems to create an innovative human resource operation that delivers flexibility and agility.},

   abstract                      = {Many firms buy cloud services from cloud vendors, such as Amazon Web Services to serve end users. One of the key factors that affect the quality of cloud services is congestion. Congestion leads to a potential loss of end users, resulting in lower demand for cloud services. Although discount can stimulate demand, its effect under congestion is ambiguous; a higher discount leads to higher demand, but it can further lead to higher congestion, thereby lowering demand. We explore how congestion moderates both cloud vendor pricing and the buyer’s fulfillment decisions. We seek to answer how the congestion sensitivity of the end users and the cost of technology impact buyer profitability and the cloud vendor’s choice of discount. We also examine how the cost of technology determines the buyer’s willingness to pass on savings to end users. Our results show that the buyer is not necessarily worse off even when the end users are more intolerant to congestion. In fact, when end users are more congestion sensitive, the demand for cloud services can sometimes increase, and the discount offered by the vendor can decrease. We also observe that a lower cost of technology can sometimes hurt the buyer, and the buyer can pass on lower benefits to end users.},

   abstract                      = {Digital transformations often require firms to align and synchronize their information technology (IT) and business initiatives. In this context, one important question that managers face is where they should focus most when aligning IT and business for leveraging IT investment for firm performance. Authors argue that firms that focus on IT–business alignment at the later stages (i.e., IT delivery and IT change) are better able to translate their IT investment into revenue than firms that focus on IT–business alignment at the early stage (i.e., IT investment planning) of the IT lifecycle. They use archival data from more than 120 firms in India and find that the positive relationship between IT investment and firm revenue is stronger for firms that focus on IT delivery–business alignment or IT change–business alignment than for firms that focus on IT investment planning–business alignment. In addition, they find that at higher levels of IT investment, firms that focus on IT change–business alignment or IT delivery–business alignment have higher revenue than firms that focus on IT investment planning–business alignment, whereas at low levels of IT investment, firms that focus on IT investment planning–business alignment outperform firms that focus on IT delivery–business alignment or IT change–business alignment. Taken together, these findings can help managers to improve the success of their digital transformation efforts by tailoring their alignment efforts across planning, delivery, and change stages.},

   abstract                      = {In this work, we investigate how applying human-like characteristics to customer service chatbots can influence retail outcomes. This is an important managerial question as creating effective chatbot experiences through messaging platforms has proven difficult for organizations. Often, chatbot developers apply characteristics such as giving a chatbot a human name, adding humor, and so on, without knowing how these features influence end user behavior. Implementing a field experiment in collaboration with a dual channel clothing retailer based in the United States, we automate a used clothing buy-back process, such that individuals engage with the retailer's autonomous chatbot to describe the used clothes they wish to sell, obtain a cash offer, and (if they accept) print a shipping label to finalize the transaction. We provide evidence that, in this retail setting, anthropomorphism is beneficial for transaction outcomes, but that it also leads to significant increases in consumers’ sensitivity to the offer amount. We argue that the latter effect occurs because, as a chatbot becomes more human-like, consumers shift to a fairness evaluation or negotiating mindset.},

These efforts rely on consumers to scan the products they purchase using these apps, which we refer to as consumer scanning technology (CST). CST can be an alternative to the conventional interorganizational information technology (IOIT) that relies on collaboration between supply chain firms. This paper develops a theoretical model to examine the value of CST to learn supply chain (demand) information and the impact of CST on IOIT. Using an extensive simulation analysis based on real-world data from a manufacturer that has implemented a CST program, we show that the value of CST to a manufacturer can be substantial and provide insights into how market conditions affect the value.},

This paper analyzes the equilibrium implications of platform recommendation as an intervention that shifts (a portion of) consumer search effort and demand from the rest of the market to the recommended products. Our analysis provides the theoretical basis for determining which types of products the platform should recommend to optimize total producer profits or consumer surplus. We find that the quality and taste-dispersion dimensions can interact to affect the overall effectiveness of product recommendation strategies, and, in general, recommendation strategies based on observed price or sales signals cannot guarantee the optimal outcome.},

   abstract                      = {This research investigates how a shift from traditional loyalty cards to mobile-driven loyalty apps affects consumers’ reward redemption patterns, purchase behaviors, and store-level competition. The findings indicate that loyalty app adoption is associated with increased expenditure and purchase frequency as well as more active point redemption. In a multivendor loyalty program (MVLP) context, the use of loyalty apps is associated with spillover effects in which case customers visit more stores that they had not previously considered and exhibit diminished allegiance to their focal shop after they adopt a loyalty app. Finally, the adoption of loyalty apps is related to deal-prone behaviors because informed consumers tend to selectively purchase highly discounted products. Our findings provide several valuable implications for managers and platform owners who are considering launching mobile loyalty programs (LPs) and participating in an MVLP market. Although the merits of loyalty app adoption are apparent, we caution against potential downsides at individual store levels. Many customers are likely to succumb to deals, selectively purchasing highly discounted products with low margins through loyalty apps. The thrust of LPs should be directed toward fostering a strong connection with a brand, going beyond the promise of deals and promotions.},

   abstract                      = {Global e-commerce sales have experienced unprecedented growth for the past years and have reached over $2 trillion annually. One interesting phenomenon along with this remarkable growth is that giant online retailers, such as Amazon.com in the United States and JD.com in China, open their platforms and allow third-party sellers to offer products there, thus inviting competition. We explore why an online retailer would open its platform and why a third-party seller would join the platform. We highlight the role of a spillover effect that, when the third-party seller joins the retailer’s platform, more consumers become aware of the third-party seller’s existence and its products which are not even listed on the retailer’s platform. We characterize how the third-party seller’s optimal selling strategies should vary with and how the retailer’s openness decision should be determined by the extent of the spillover effect and the retailer’s initial awareness advantage. Compared with the case without a spillover effect, the spillover effect makes the retailer less likely to open its platform, but it makes the third-party seller more likely to sell identical products on an open retailer platform; the spillover effect always (weakly) benefits the third-party seller, but it does not necessarily hurt the retailer.},

   abstract                      = {Overcrowding in emergency rooms (ERs) is a common yet nagging problem. It not only is costly for hospitals but also compromises care quality and patient experience. Our paper provides solid evidence that telemedicine can significantly improve ER care delivery, especially in the presence of demand and supply fluctuations. We believe such findings are critical for ERs, due to the special setting of unscheduled arrivals leading to high unpredictability of patient traffic. Additional evidence suggests that the efficiency gained from telemedicine does not come at the expense of lower care quality or higher medical expenditure, which points to telemedicine as a feasible solution to the ER overcrowding problem. For healthcare practitioners, our paper highlights the general applicability of telemedicine through the “hub and spoke” architecture. Besides increasing patients’ access to more immediate care from specialists who were not available otherwise, telemedicine enables flexible resource allocation for any hospitals, regardless of where hospitals are located. Our research also provides ground for policymakers to incentivize hospitals to adopt telemedicine in ER, which we believe is critical given the relatively low adoption rate, the lack of direct evidence on its effectiveness, and the current inflexibility of reimbursement policies regarding the application of ER telemedicine.},

   abstract                      = {Contemporary social media fueled social protest is self-organized, rapidly dynamic, and decentralized, constitutes vast populations, and is shaped by multiple and concurrent channels of information flows. Such protest activity is captured in the concept of social protest cycles, which are short periods of intense and contentious protest activity characterized by temporal dynamics, a large repertoire of protest action, confrontation and potential violence, and possible institutional action. Social protest cycles are the microfoundations of long-term social movements. They contain the seeds of potential societal transformation because their intense collective action can be constructively harnessed toward change. This paper examines the role of social media in social protest cycles. Drawing from the theoretical concept of sociomaterial assemblages, we conceptualize the social media enabled social protest cycle as an assemblage having social (e.g., people, elected leaders, police, judges) and technical (e.g., social media applications, online petition applications) components. We analyze how the social protest cycle transforms through performative intra-actions. The empirical context for the study is a social media enabled social protest cycle that emerged after a fatal rape incident in New Delhi, India. Data pertaining to the social protest cycle over the period December 17–25, 2012, were collected from social media activity on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, online blogs, and newspaper websites. Through mixed methods analysis we identify three intra-actions, consolidation, expansion, and intensification, and theorize how they transform the social protest cycle over time. The paper contributes to the information systems literature that studies social media–enabled social protest action. As theoretical contributions, it develops (1) the notion of intra-actions as organizing mechanisms and (2) a relational ontology for social media–enabled social protest action. Through these contributions, we suggest that the power of social media lies in its socially produced and emergent relationships with other entities in the social protest cycle.},

   abstract                      = {This paper investigates how citizens’ uncertainty in e-government services can be managed. First, we draw from uncertainty reduction theory, and propose that transparency and trust are two key means of reducing citizens’ uncertainty in e-government services. Second, we identify two key sets of relevant drivers of e-government service use: (1) information quality characteristics, i.e., accuracy and completeness; and (2) channel characteristics, i.e., convenience and personalization. We propose that the means of uncertainty reduction, information quality characteristics, and channel characteristics are interrelated factors that jointly influence citizens’ intentions to use e-government. We tested our model with 4,430 Hong Kong citizens’ reactions to two e-government services: government websites and online appointment booking. Our results show that the information quality and channel characteristics predict citizens’ intentions to use e-government. Furthermore, transparency and trust mediate as well as moderate the effects of information quality and channel characteristics on intentions. A follow-up survey found that citizens’ intentions predict use and ultimately, citizens’ satisfaction.},

   abstract                      = {This study examines the dynamic relationships between firm-generated content (FGC), user-generated content (UGC), traditional media, and offline light vehicle sales. Data were collected from the official Facebook and Twitter pages of 30 U.S. car brands from 2009 to 2015. Our results suggest that Facebook and Twitter are heterogeneous in terms of their effect on offline vehicle sales; FGC is more effective than UGC for influencing offline light vehicle sales; viral impressions from Facebook and Twitter are essential, although effects vary for the various social media platforms, FGC, and UGC; and a firm’s marketing efforts and UGC both have a long-term effect on sales, with the long-term effect of a firm’s marketing efforts outlasting that of UGC. We also documented the within-Twitter synergistic effect between FGC and UGC for offline car sales and cross-channel substitution relationships between FGC and both Facebook and traditional media and Twitter and traditional media. Our study implies that managers who attempt to maximize multichannel marketing for offline sales of durable goods should consider (1) the nature of each platform, (2) the number of potential audiences each platform can reach, and (3) the user basis of each platform.},

Yet little is known about how physicians’ online and offline activities affect each other and, consequently, the healthcare system. We collected data from both online and offline channels to study physicians’ online-offline behavior dynamics. We find that physicians’ online activities can lead to a higher service quantity in offline channels, whereas offline activities may reduce physicians’ online services because of resource constraints. We also find that the more offline patients that physicians serve, the more articles the physicians will likely share in online healthcare platforms. These findings are of great importance to practitioners and policy makers. Our work provides evidence that online healthcare platforms supplement offline services and thus lessen the concern that physicians’ participation in online healthcare platforms will negatively influence offline healthcare services. Our findings also indicate the need for the improvement of online-offline coordination and better system design.},

   abstract                      = {Social media harassment, a cyberbullying behavior, poses a serious threat to users and platform owners of social media. In this paper, we contextualize the bystander intervention framework and reporting literature to social media in order to understand why bystanders report social media harassment. Our contextualized intervention framework focuses on three sociotechnical aspects—the online social environment, characteristics of the technology platform, and their interplay—that explain bystander reporting on social media platforms. We tested the model using data gathered from active Facebook users. Our findings direct practitioners’ attention to the role of the platform in encouraging bystanders to help stop social media harassment. For policy makers, our findings direct attention to supporting programs that encourage social media users to feel responsible for reporting harassment and making transparent the outcomes of reporting social media harassment using anonymous reporting tools. For platform owners, our findings direct attention to investing in tools that enable anonymous reporting, to fostering a climate that encourages reporting, and to ensuring that all users understand that reporting social media harassment results in swift, effective responses from platform owners. Taken together, we believe our research offer insight into how to build safer and secure social media platforms.},

   abstract                      = {Despite the popular emergence of peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms, relevant research investigating the role of these platforms on P2P markets still lags. In this paper, we present a model to study the market incentives of P2P lending platforms' optimal information-reporting strategies when the following exist: (i) uncertainty on the return of loans and (ii) competition from entrants. We focus on the information bias of platforms driven by demand-side actors—investors’ optimism/pessimism about risk—while we keep the platforms being rational. We characterize platforms' equilibrium reporting strategies under different market conditions. Surprisingly, we find that when uncertainty is significant, and the threat of entry is strong but not detrimental, the platform has incentives to bias information toward investors' biased beliefs. This result demonstrates a case where competition and uncertainty may jointly lead to information bias. However, a properly designed uncertainty-resolution mechanism could reduce the incentive. Our findings contribute to the literature on the P2P lending market by analyzing platform decisions and offer policy implications for regulating P2P lending market.},

We first develop a data science approach to detect customer misbehavior on social media and devise intervention strategies to deter it. Our design science approach achieves superior performance, improving detection by 7%–9% compared with traditional methods. We then implement two types of intervention policies based on injunctive (i.e., a punishment policy) and descriptive norms (i.e., a common identity policy) to restrain customer misbehavior. The results of field experiments indicate that punishment considerably reduces customer misbehavior in the short term, but this effect decays over time, whereas common identity has a smaller but more persistent effect on misbehavior reduction. In addition, punishing dysfunctional customers decreases their purchase frequency, whereas imposing a common identity increases it. Our results also show that combining the two policies effectively alleviates the detrimental effect of punishment, especially in the long run.},

   abstract                      = {Nonlinear usage-based pricing is applied extensively in software markets. Customers of software products usually cannot vary their required usage volume, a property we label local demand inelasticity. For instance, a client firm that needs a sales force automation software either buys one user license for every salesperson or does not buy at all. It is unlikely to buy licenses for some but not all salespersons. This demand feature violates a critical assumption of the standard nonlinear pricing literature that consumers are flexible with their usage volume, and their valuation changes smoothly with usage volume. Consequently, standard nonlinear pricing solutions are inapplicable to many software products. This paper studies the optimal nonlinear usage-based pricing of software when customers' demand is locally inelastic. This unique demand feature necessitates a new approach to solve the nonlinear pricing problem. We show that under a weak ordering condition of customer types, this complex pricing problem can be decomposed into a set of much simpler subproblems with known solutions. Our pricing solution is easily implementable and applicable to a broad range of demand systems, including those described by the families of exponential and normal distributions. Moreover, local demand inelasticity has a critical impact on key efficiency results.},

We draw from research on brand equity and customer loyalty, ICT innovation management, and strategy complementarity to propose a model that includes new constructs representing ICT service innovation, i.e., service leadership, and its two complementary strategies, i.e., customization-personalization control and technology leadership, and how their interactions influence customer loyalty through customer-based brand equity. We test our model using data from an online survey of 1,210 customers of mobile data services. The results show that service leadership and customization-personalization control have significant direct impacts on ICT service providers' brand equity. Moreover, when either the level of technology leadership or the level of customization-personalization control is high, the impact of service leadership on brand equity is enhanced. In turn, brand equity has significant impacts on consumers' affective loyalty and conative loyalty, but not on cognitive loyalty. Our study contributes to the literature on service management and service science, and in particular to the management of ICT service innovation in a consumer technology market.},

   abstract                      = {Scarcity-based marketing strategy has been prevalently implemented in reward-based crowdfunding in the form of reward limits, whereby campaign creators restrict the number of backers for each reward tier. This study uncovers the effect of reward limits on eventual and concurrent funding performance. Specifically, we performed campaign-level and campaign day–level analyses on a unique data set from a dominant crowdfunding platform. At the campaign level, we determined that setting reward limits at the beginning of a campaign is beneficial, with the number of limited reward tiers exerting an inverted-U-shaped relationship with campaign performance. Further exploration of different forms of reward limits suggests that the scarcity effects largely originate from limited edition and price discount rewards. At the campaign day level, we determined that incorporating new limited edition rewards is helpful for attracting new contributions, whereas depleted price discount rewards will demotivate subsequent contributions. In addition, the goal-directed mechanism in crowdfunding plays an influential role in shaping scarcity effects. Our findings highlight the importance of considering backer-as-consumer needs in crowdfunding campaign design and the dynamics of campaign attribute changes in the fundraising process. Our findings also provide important practical implications for platform operators, campaign creators, and marketers.},

   abstract                      = {Online reputation has become a key marketing-mix variable in the digital economy. Our study helps managers decide on the effort they should use to manage online reputation. We consider an online reputation race in which it is important not just to manage the absolute reputation, but also the relative rating. That is, to stay ahead, a firm should try to have ratings that are better than those of its competitors. Our findings are particularly significant for platform owners (such as Expedia or Yelp) to strategically grow their base of participating firms: growing the middle of the market (firms with average ratings) is the best option considering the goals of the platform and the other stakeholders, namely incumbents and consumers. For firms, we find that they should increase their effort when the mean market rating increases. Another key insight for firms is that, sometimes, adversity can come disguised as an opportunity. When an adverse event strikes the industry (such as a reduction in sales margin or an increase in the cost of effort), a firm’s profit can increase if it can manage this event better than its competitors.},

We find significant differences between new and experienced drivers in both learning behavior and driving decisions. Drivers benefit significantly from their ability to learn from not only information directly observable in the local market but also aggregate information on demand flows across markets. Interestingly, our policy simulations indicate that information that is noisy at the individual level becomes valuable when aggregated across relevant spatial and temporal dimensions. Moreover, we find that the value of information does not increase monotonically with the scale and frequency of information sharing. Our results also provide important evidence that efficient information sharing can lead to a welfare increase because of potential market expansion. Efficient information sharing can bring additional income-generating opportunities that could be unfulfilled. Overall, this study not only explains driver decision-making behavior but also provides taxi companies with an implementable information-sharing strategy to improve overall market efficiency.},

   abstract                      = {For decades, brand managers have monitored brand health with the use of consumer surveys, which have been refined to address issues related to sampling bias, response bias, leading questions, etc. However, with the advance of Web 2.0 and the internet, consumers have turned to social media to express their opinions on a variety of topics and, subsequently, have generated an extremely large amount of interaction data with brands. Analyzing these publicly available data to measure brand health has attracted great research attention. In this study, we focus on developing a method to measure brand favorability while accounting for the measure biases exhibited by social media posters. Specifically, we propose a probabilistic graphical model–based collective inference framework and implement a block-based Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling technique to obtain an adjusted brand favorability measure that is correlated with traditional survey-based measures used by brands. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, we evaluate it using more than 3,300 brands and about 205 million unique users that interact with those brands collected through Facebook. Our model performs very well, providing brand managers with a new method to more accurately measure consumer opinions toward the brand using social media data.},

   abstract                      = {Recently companies are increasingly adopting intelligent technologies, such as autonomous tools and artificial intelligence, to assist complex knowledge works that are traditionally carried out by human experts. These tools can independently learn and execute novel actions. The input–output relationships of these tools, however, are unknowable to human experts. This calls for analysis of how humans may work differently while interacting with such tools. To this end, we conduct a comparative case study at one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers. We investigate how chip designers interact with two families of design technologies: one following a traditional designer-centric approach in which the designer knows what outputs particular inputs to the tools will generate, and another relying on autonomous tools that continually surprise the user. Our inquiry reveals that, when using autonomous tools, designers can hardly understand the design generated by the tools and become more like laboratory experimentalists in that their primary job is experimenting with different inputs and assessing the quality of the finished design. Their interactions with the tools are marked by ambiguity, and the design is moved forward along multiple design trajectories in accordance with a multifarious temporality.},

   abstract                      = {Digital technologies have led to the emergence of many platforms in our economy today. In certain platform networks, buyers in one market purchase services from providers in many other markets, whereas in others, buyers primarily purchase services from providers within the same market. Accordingly, network interconnectivity—which measures the degree to which consumers in one market purchase services from service providers in a different market—varies across different industries. We examine how network interconnectivity affects interactions between an incumbent platform serving multiple markets and an entrant platform seeking to enter one of these markets. Our model yields several interesting results. First, even if the entrant can advertise at no cost, it still may not want to make every user in a local market aware of its service, as doing so may trigger a competitive response from the incumbent. Second, having more mobile buyers, which increases interconnectivity between markets, can reduce the incumbent’s incentive to fight and, thus, increase the entrant’s incentive to expand. Third, stronger interconnectivity between markets may or may not make the incumbent more defensible: when advertising is not costly and mobile buyers consume in both their local markets and the markets they visit, a large number of mobile buyers will increase the entrant’s profitability, thereby making it difficult for the incumbent to deter entry. However, when advertising is costly or mobile buyers only consume in the markets they travel to, a large number of mobile buyers will help the incumbent deter entry. When advertising cost is at an intermediate level, the entrant prefers a market with moderate interconnectivity between markets. Fourth, we find that even if advanced targeting technologies can enable the entrant to also advertise to mobile buyers, the entrant may choose not to do so in order to avoid triggering the incumbent’s competitive response. Finally, we find that the presence of network effects is likely to decrease the entrant’s profit. Our results offer managerial implications for platform firms and help understand their performance heterogeneity.},

   abstract                      = {Open collaboration platforms have fundamentally changed the way that knowledge is produced, disseminated, and consumed. Although the community governance and open collaboration model of Wikipedia confers many benefits, its decentralized nature can leave questions of information poverty and skewness to the mercy of the system's natural dynamics. In this paper, we leverage a large-scale natural experiment to gain a causal understanding of how exogenous content contributions to Wikipedia articles affect the attention that they attract and how that attention spills over to other articles in the information network. We find a positive feedback loop: content contribution leads to significant and long-lasting increases of attention and future contribution. Unfortunately, this also suggests that impoverished regions of information networks are likely to remain so in the absence of intervention. However, our analysis reveals a potential solution. Articles in impoverished regions of information networks are particularly positioned to benefit from the phenomenon of attention spillovers. Using a simulation that is calibrated with real-world link traffic of the Wikipedia network, we show that an attention contagion policy, which focuses editorial effort coherently on impoverished regions, can lead to as much as a twofold gain in attention relative to unguided contributions.},

In addition, the research highlights a tradeoff in price-rank decisions: A price rank that drives more clicks does not necessarily lead to more conversions; to drive traffic, managers should strive for an extreme (i.e., either high or low) to elicit more clicks, then follow up with online engagement tools (e.g., cross-selling and product recommendations). To maximize direct revenue, managers instead should strive for moderate ranks to satisfy consumers’ desire for a compromise between price and quality. However, consumers without uncertainty tend to rely less on price rank, so the effects diminish among specific keywords and increase among popular keywords. In order to achieve the desired price ranks, firms participating in PLA might monitor and adjust their advertising offers. There are commonly two specific avenues: Change the product price if the required change is within a certain range or change the advertised product if the required price change is beyond a certain range.},

   abstract                      = {We analyze outcomes of two randomized field experiments to study the effect of binge-watching on subscription to video on demand. In both cases, we offered access to subscription video on demand (SVoD) to a random set of households for several weeks and used another random set of households as control group. In both cases, we find that the households induced to binge-watch TV shows are less likely to pay for SVoD after the free trials. Our results suggest that induced binge-watchers deplete the content of interest to them very quickly, which reduces their short-term willingness to pay for SVoD. We also show that carefully crafted recommendation reminders aimed at widening the preferences of consumers for content offset the negative effect of binge-watching and lessen the concerns of binge-watchers with lack of content refresh, and thus these reminders may help content providers manage supply costs, which may otherwise become prohibitive with frequent updates to SVoD catalogs.},

   abstract                      = {The internet of things (IoT) is rapidly becoming one of the most popular emerging technologies in business and society. One of the major verticals that has recently begun to effectively use IoT technologies is the retail industry. Given the unprecedented opportunities IoT generates for brands and retailers, it is important to glean timely insights regarding the business value of IoT and understand whether the introduction of an IoT technology as an alternative purchase channel for consumers affects the sales of physical products. Using empirical data from a multinational online retailer who adopted an IoT technology that largely automates the consumers’ purchases and employing a quasi-experimental framework, we study the effect of the introduction of IoT as an alternative sales channel on product sales. Our analyses reveal a statistically and economically significant increase in sales and demonstrate the business value of the IoT channel for retailers and brands. In addition, we conduct other analyses of IoT to delve into the effect of heterogeneity and empirically validate the underlying mechanisms by examining the impact of IoT for products in different price ranges, levels of substitutability, and product categories. For instance, our analyses reveal that less expensive and more differentiated products, as well as experience and utilitarian goods, can accrue higher benefits leveraging more effectively novel IoT technologies. This is the first paper to study the impact of an IoT technology on product sales, drawing important implications for devices and technologies largely automating the purchase process.},

   abstract                      = {This study investigates the creative idea generation process in an open innovation platform. The idea generation process is simultaneously influenced by multiple activities: knowledge acquisition from participants’ interactions with each other’s ideas, deliberate practice through persistent participation, and learning through failures. Due to the dynamic interplay across these activities, it is challenging to identify each activity’s influence on creative ideation outcomes using reduced-form regression analysis. To overcome these challenges, we employ a comprehensive empirical framework, the mutually exciting spatiotemporal point process model with unobserved heterogeneity, which endogenizes the occurrences of these activities in continuous time and allows for user-dependent effects. By utilizing the activity stream data of 13,028 participants from 2010 to 2016 in an open innovation platform, we uncovered synergistic effects of these activities on creative outcomes. We find that knowledge acquired through interaction with others (i.e., stimulus ideas) plays a vital role in the creative ideation process, but their effect is more nuanced than what we have known so far. In contrast to the prior belief that distant analogies, stimulus ideas outside of a problem domain, spur creativity, we find that distant analogies lead to failures. Yet, we further find that such failures are indispensable to the creative ideation process because failures motivate idea generators (1) to acquire more knowledge by increasing their future interactions with other participants’ ideas (learning from others), and (2) to persist in generating ideas that lead to improvements in their ability to apply the acquired knowledge and to identify innovation tasks that are relevant to their stock of acquired knowledge (learning by doing). Our results indicate that failures are a stronger driver of the learning activities than successes. Based on our findings, we offer insights on how to cultivate creativity in an open innovation setting.},

   abstract                      = {When using mobile apps that extensively collect user information, privacy uncertainty, which is consumers’ difficulty in assessing the privacy of the data they entrust to others, is a major concern. Using a simulated app-buying experiment, we find that privacy uncertainty, which is mainly driven by uncertainty about what data are collected and how they are used and protected, is indeed a significant influencer of one’s intentions to use a mobile app and the perceived risk associated with that use, as well as the price a potential consumer is willing to pay for an app. Our results further show that the uncertainty concerning the data collected while using a mobile app drives consumers’ decisions more than the uncertainty regarding data that are collected at the time an app is downloaded. To investigate whether privacy uncertainty continues to be a factor after a consumer has already started using an app, we conducted a survey of users of wellness and personal finance apps. The results indicate that privacy uncertainty is a lingering concern because it continues to influence a user’s intention to continue using an app and the perceived risk associated with that continued use.},

   abstract                      = {In the past decade, the proliferation of online marketplace lending has been disrupting the consumer credit market, especially for personal loans for debt consolidation. These lenders, for example, Lending Club, transcend the geographic boundaries within which local banks operate and offer homogeneous access and terms to borrowers. However, the ultimate benefits borrowers derive from marketplace lending can differ significantly because local alternatives may replace marketplace loans when available and favorable. Correspondingly, if local bank competition drives the substitution of an existing marketplace loan with a traditional bank loan, the promise of equal benefits to all borrowers from marketplace lending is unlikely to fully materialize. This competitive dynamic has implications for policy making, particularly in judging the ramifications of bank mergers and acquisitions (M&As). Our results indicate that a borrower who resides in a more competitive market is more likely to pay off a P2P loan early by making a large, one-time payment compared with a borrower from a less competitive market, indicating a substitution with a local bank loan. Thus, borrowers from different markets do not benefit equally from online marketplace lending, disrupting the consumer credit market. In particular, consumers in smaller markets continue to be disadvantaged because of the absence of competitive intensity. This is a consequence of traditional banks competing within their local markets and incentivized to attract marketplace borrowers to traditional loans primarily by their local market conditions. Therefore, unless geographic frictions in traditional lending markets are removed, digital disruptions cannot equalize the benefits to consumers.},

   abstract                      = {Consumers rely on review platforms when deciding where to stay, where to eat, what movies to watch, or even which doctor to use. This is great for consumers, but it has makes online review platforms a target for fraud. Review platforms have responded by developing tools and algorithms to identify potentially fraudulent reviews. But the question remains: What should platforms do with fraudulent reviews after detecting them? Our research answers this question using randomized experiments and large-scale data analysis from Yelp’s review platform. Our results show that after detecting fraudulent reviews, platforms should keep them on their platforms, but should display them with a flag that identifies them as potentially fraudulent. Doing so will increase consumers' trust in the platform by demonstrating that the platform takes fraud serious and will also penalize dishonest businesses. Together, these results provide strong managerial and policy guidance to developing truthful, transparent, and accountable online ecosystems. Our research topic is particularly timely given the presence of misinformation on technology platforms, the incentives of actors to exploit anonymity to manipulate consumer beliefs, and the influence these actions can have on consumer trust.},

   abstract                      = {Job erosion is a major concern globally, especially given the COVID-19 pandemic. Unemployment and low wages remain pressing societal challenges in the wake of increased automation, more so for traditionally disadvantaged groups in the labor market, such as women, minorities, and the elderly. However, workers who possess relevant information technology (IT) skills may have an edge in an increasingly digital economy. In this study, we examine the role of IT skills in labor market outcomes for workers, using a household IT use survey from an emerging economy that captures detailed, individual-level data on IT skills, which are also integrated with data on workers’ wages, occupations, and industries between 2007 and 2015. The results indicate that basic IT skills increase individuals’ employment probability, which is driven by both higher labor force participation and a higher probability of transitioning from unemployment to employment, after accounting for the decision to participate in the workforce. Advanced IT skills do not provide a significant incremental effect on employment probability on top of basic IT skills. However, having advanced IT skills helps workers to earn higher wages while incrementally increasing the probability that they are employed in higher-paid jobs. Interestingly, the effect of basic IT skills on employment is significantly larger for the female and older workforce that typically has a higher preference for flexible work options. These results emphasize the importance of providing necessary IT access and offering basic IT training to traditionally disadvantaged groups to close the IT skills gap and the digital divide. We offer implications for the future of work, education, and public policy for designing IT training policies for workers, students, and organizations to stimulate employment with higher wages, particularly in developing economies and for traditionally disadvantaged segments of the workforce, such as women and the elderly, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic.},

   abstract                      = {In the digital era, it is increasingly important to understand how privacy decisions are made because information is frequently perceived as a commodity that is mismanaged. The preponderance of privacy literature focuses on individual-level information privacy concern and personal self-disclosure decisions. We propose that a more versatile multilevel description is required to enable exploration of complex privacy decisions that involve co-owned (i.e., group) information in increasingly sophisticated digital environments. We define the concepts of group and individual information privacy, “we-privacy” and “I-privacy” respectively, as the ability of an individual or group to construct, regulate, and apply the rules for managing their information and interaction with others. We develop the theory of multilevel information privacy (TMIP), which uses the theory of communication privacy management and the developmental theory of privacy as foundations for a social rule-based (i.e., normative) process of making privacy decisions that evolve over time with experience. The TMIP contributes to the privacy literature by drawing from prominent social psychology theories of group behavior (i.e., social identity and self-categorization theories) to explain how privacy decisions can be made by individuals or groups (i.e., social units) or social units acting as members of a particular group. We contend that technology complicates the privacy decision-making process by adding unique environmental characteristics that can influence the social identity assumed for a particular privacy decision, the estimation of the cost-benefit components of the privacy calculus, and the application and evolution of the norms that define the rules for information and interaction management. We discuss the implications of the TMIP for information systems research and provide a research agenda.},

   abstract                      = {In many markets of the digital economy, some products are more prone to online piracy than some of their substitutes. These situations of asymmetric online piracy distort the competition between products. Using the French antipiracy law known as HADOPI (Haute Autorité pour la diffusion des œuvres et la protection des droits d'auteur sur internet) as a natural experiment, we study the asymmetric effects of online piracy on cinema admissions. Applying four estimation strategies at different levels of observation (town, movie, country, and consumer), we find that introduction of the law is associated with a 9% increase in the market share of American movies but that this increase occurs at the expense of other movies. These findings primarily originate from a high initial level of asymmetric piracy between American and other movies. This asymmetry was attenuated by the antipiracy law, resulting in a fiercer competition between movies and, as a side effect, in a decrease in the legal consumption of less-pirated products. These results have important implications for firms whose profits may be affected by legislation fighting piracy as well as for governments for the design of their policy.},

   abstract                      = {Matching with preferences has great potential to coordinate the efficient allocation of scarce resources in organizations when monetary transfers are not available. It is well known that it is impossible to combine all three properties of truthfulness, efficiency, and fairness (i.e., envy freeness) in matching with preferences. Established mechanisms are either efficient or envy free, and the efficiency loss in envy-free mechanisms is substantial. We focus on a widespread representative of a matching problem: course assignment where students have preferences for courses and organizers have priorities over students. An important feature in course assignment is that a course has a maximum capacity and a minimum required quota. This is also a requirement in many other matching applications, such as school choice, hospital-residents matching, or the assignment of workers to jobs. We introduce RESPCT, a mechanism that respects minimum quotas and is truthful, efficient, and has low levels of envy. The reduction in envy is significant and is due to two remarkably effective heuristics. We provide analytical and experimental results based on field data from a large-scale course assignment application. These results have led to a policy change and the proposed assignment system is now being used to match hundreds of students every semester.},

   abstract                      = {A key approach in many organizations to address the myriad of information security threats is encouraging employees to better understand and comply with information security policies (ISPs). Despite a significant body of academic research in this area, a commonly held but questionable assumption in these studies is that noncompliance simply represents the opposite of compliance. Hence, explaining compliance is only half of the story, and there is a pressing need to understand the causes of noncompliance, as well. If organizational leaders understood what leads a normally compliant employee to become noncompliant, future security breaches might be avoided or minimized. In this study, we found that compliant and noncompliant behaviors can be better explained by uncovering actions that focus not only on efficacious coping behaviors, but also those that focus on frustrated users who must sometimes cope with emotions, too. Employees working from a basis of emotion-focused coping are unable to address the threat and, feeling overwhelmed, focus only on controlling their emotions, merely making themselves feel better. Based on our findings, organizations can enhance their security by understanding the “tipping point” where employees’ focus likely changes from problem-solving to emotion appeasement, and instead push them into a more constructive direction.Yan Chen is an associate professor at Florida International University.

In our paper, we propose a set of theory-grounded data-driven measures that allow us to measure not only product type (search vs. experience and horizontal vs. vertical differentiation) but also sources of uncertainty and to what extent consumer reviews help resolve uncertainty. We used product rating data from Amazon.com to illustrate the relative importance of fit in driving product utility and the importance of search for determining fit for each product category at Amazon. Our results also show that, whereas ratings based on verified purchasers are informative of objective product values, the current Amazon review system appears to have limited ability to resolve fit uncertainty. Industry practitioners could utilize our approaches to quantitatively measure product positioning to support marketing strategy for retailers and manufacturers, covering an expanded group of products.},

Contemporary treatment for breast cancer is complex and involves highly specialized medical professionals collaborating in a series of information-intensive processes. This poses significant challenges to optimization of treatment plans for individual patients. We propose a novel framework that enables personalization and customization of treatment plans for early stage breast cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy. Using a series of simulation experiments benchmarked with real-world clinical data, we demonstrate that the treatment plans generated from our proposed framework consistently outperform those from the existing practices in balancing the risk of local tumor recurrence and radiation-induced adverse effects. Our research sheds new light on how to combine domain knowledge and patient data in developing effective decision-support tools for clinical use. Although our research is specifically geared toward radiotherapy planning for breast cancer, the design principles of our framework can be applied to the personalization of treatment plans for patients with other chronic diseases that typically involve complications and comorbidities.},

These bilateral reviews are important information sources in the decision-making process of both buyers and sellers. In this study, we develop a comprehensive relational topic modeling approach to analyze bilateral reviews for better online transaction prediction. The prediction results will enable the platform to increase the chance that the buyer and seller reach a transaction by presenting buyers with offerings that are more likely to lead to a transaction. Within the framework of the relational topic model, we embed a topic structure with both shared and corpus-specific topics to better handle text corpora generated from different sources. Our model facilitates the extraction of the appropriate topic structure from different document collections that helps enhance the transaction prediction performance. Comprehensive experiments conducted on real-world data sets collected from sharing economy platforms demonstrate that our new model significantly outperforms other alternatives. The robust results obtained from multiple sets of comparisons demonstrate the value of bilateral reviews if they are processed properly. Our approach can be applied to many platforms where bilateral reviews are available.},

Nevertheless, CIO structural power should not be overlooked because it could amplify (i.e., positively moderate) the impact of CIO issue selling to digital innovation outcomes. In addition, we identify four enabling forces of CIO issue selling effectiveness: (1) CIO strategic decision-making authority, (2) CIO/TMT partnership, (3) CIO information technologies (IT)–related strategic knowledge, and (4) CIO political savvy. Matched-pair survey data collected from senior business and IT executives of 179 organizations largely support the research hypotheses.},

An ideal match is one wherein the publisher’s ad impression is assigned to the advertiser with the highest value for it. Intermediaries (e.g., Google) facilitate this match between advertisers and publishers by managing data and providing optimization tools and algorithms for serving ads. Although these markets exhibit high allocative efficiency, we argue there is considerable scope for improvement.},

The findings provide a rationale for firms to invest heavily in their social media while countering those who question the value of social media. Using a sample of 63 South Korean firms across industries over a three-year period, we find that a firm’s social media actions yield significant financial returns, and the magnitude of these financial returns depends on the types of communication actions: that is, a firm’s (broadcasted) posts versus its responses to customer messages. Our conceptual framework and empirical methodology can help firms more accurately gauge the ROI of their social media investments and tailor their efforts accordingly. Specifically, our results suggest that promptly responding to customer complaints is a key to increasing customer satisfaction and firm performance. Taken together, our study provides guidance for firms on how to optimize their social media strategies to extract greater value from social media.},

The authors use the SEC crackdown of stock promotion schemes in April 2017 to examine investor attention and the stock price reaction to fake news articles. Using data from Seeking Alpha, the authors find that fake news stories generate significantly more attention than a control sample of legitimate articles. The authors find no evidence that article commenters can detect fake news, and they find that Seeking Alpha editors have only modest ability to detect fake news. However, the authors implement several well-known machine learning algorithms based on linguistic characteristics and show that machine learning algorithms can successfully identify fake news. In addition, the stock market appears to price fake news correctly. While abnormal trading volume increases around the release of fake news, the increase is less than that observed for legitimate news. The stock price reaction to fake news is discounted when compared with legitimate news articles.},

   abstract                      = {One of the critical success factors in information technology outsourcing projects is how partners learn through interactions with each other. This learning facilitates the complex problem-solving processes and enables partners to take different perspectives, explore alternatives, and seek innovation in outsourcing projects. For this learning to occur, partners must strive to enhance collaboration, but generally, collaboration is viewed too narrowly as partners engage in coordination and cooperation independently of each other. Our framework suggests that learning is more effective when partners collaborate by cooperating to pursue jointly determined goals and coordinating to adjust their actions toward these goals. This study compares the independent model of collaboration with the interdependent model. The interdependent model suggests that coordination and cooperation mechanisms are interdependent and jointly influence learning outcomes. The findings show that the interdependent model provides a better explanation of the impact of coordination and cooperation mechanisms on relational learning than the independent model. This finding provides a more comprehensive understanding of relationship dynamics between partners. It also provides guidance for developing collaboration mechanisms that help synergize coordination and cooperation. Our study further shows that the perceptions of coordination and cooperation mechanisms are not symmetric between clients and vendors.},

   abstract                      = {The assumption that generativity engenders unbounded growth has acquired an almost taken-for-granted position in information systems and management literature. Against this premise, we examine the relationship between generativity and user base growth in the context of a digital platform. To do this, we synthesize the literature on generativity into two views, social interaction (expansion of ecosystem boundaries) and product view (expansion of product boundaries), that jointly and individually relate to user base growth. Both views help us explain how opening a platform relates to the emergence and resolution of conflicting expectations in a platform ecosystem that result in new functions and expanded use. We adopt a panel vector autoregressive approach combining data from six large transaction platforms that engaged with open-source developer communities. We found that the dominant narrative of generativity engendering growth, although generally supported by our analysis, obscures the fact that the inverse is also true; that is, growth can lead to expansion of product boundaries (inverse generativity) and that generativity can be bounded; that is, growth can stabilize ecosystem boundaries (bounded generativity). Against this background, we propose an extended generativity theory that presents generativity and growth in an integrative view and raises awareness about the limitations of the “unbounded growth” claim. We conclude that there is value in separating the two views of generativity conceptually and analytically, along with their relationship to user base growth, and we call for research on the pathways through which generativity produces growth.

   abstract                      = {Whereas modern medicine has enabled humans to live longer and more robust lives, recent years have seen a significant increase in chronic care costs. The prevention of threats to mobility is critical for chronic disease management. Researchers and physicians often analyze data from wearable motion sensor–based information systems (IS) to prevent falls. However, prior studies on fall prevention often achieve suboptimal performance because of their limited capacities in modeling data distributions. In this study, we adopt the computational design science paradigm to develop a novel fall prevention framework, which includes the hidden Markov model with generative adversarial network (HMM-GAN) that extracts temporal and sequential patterns from sensor signals and recognizes snippet states and a logistic regression that utilizes the snippet states and determines whether and when to trigger protective devices to prevent fall injuries. We evaluate the proposed framework against prevailing fall-prevention models and the HMM-GAN component against state-of-the-art sensor analytics models on large-scale data sets. Through an in-depth case study, we demonstrate how the proposed framework can lead to significantly reduced potentially catastrophic falls. Besides practical health information technology contributions, HMM-GAN offers methodological contributions to the IS knowledge base for scholars designing novel IT artifacts for healthcare applications.},

For many individuals, this wide availability of free substitutes drives users’ willingness-to-pay down. In this environment, how can platforms motivate consumers to pay for goods that they may be able to get for free? We demonstrate providing flexibility in payment through allowing users to “pay what you want,” along with providing external reference prices (ERPs) set by different sources, that is, other similar consumers or the platform itself, can influence payment. Importantly, a site-set ERP has more influence increasing payment than a socially-set ERP. An interesting nuance to this is that when the ERP is perceived to be high, the marginal effect of an increase in ERP on payment is smaller than when it is perceived to be fair; in other words, providing a fair ERP is more effective in increasing payment than providing an ERP that is too high. Altogether, platforms can leverage these findings in designing interfaces to provide information that can motivate consumers to pay for digital goods.},

How insightful are reviews of physicians on a physician review website to potential patients when the ratings cluster tightly around an average for all physicians? Are there costs to the physicians, the patients, and to society as a whole? When all the students at a university score “A” grades on most courses, are there consequences for the university, the students, and potential employers? This paper calls the “clustering around a mean” phenomenon “information compression” and the systems in which it occurs (e.g., universities, students, employers) “judgment networks.” When there is extensive information compression in a system, measures such as ratings or grades have little value for decision makers. When all five-star hotels in a city score an average of 4.5 does it really matter which one a traveler chooses? The paper introduces a way of measuring information compression. It also suggests ways for organizations to overcome the negative consequences of information compression for themselves and their various stakeholders.},

   abstract                      = {Although future regulations increasingly advocate that AI applications must be interpretable by users, we know little about how such explainability can affect human information processing. By conducting two experimental studies, we help to fill this gap. We show that explanations pave the way for AI systems to reshape users' understanding of the world around them. Specifically, state-of-the-art explainability methods evoke mental model adjustments that are subject to confirmation bias, allowing misconceptions and mental errors to persist and even accumulate. Moreover, mental model adjustments create spillover effects that alter users' behavior in related but distinct domains where they do not have access to an AI system. These spillover effects of mental model adjustments risk manipulating user behavior, promoting discriminatory biases, and biasing decision making. The reported findings serve as a warning that the indiscriminate use of modern explainability methods as an isolated measure to address AI systems' black-box problems can lead to unintended, unforeseen problems because it creates a new channel through which AI systems can influence human behavior in various domains.},

Using a unique data set collected by massive sensor networks in a petascale national supercomputing center, we first present an explanatory model to identify key factors affecting energy consumption in supercomputing. Our analytic results show that workload distribution among the nodes has significant effects and could effectively be leveraged to improve energy efficiency. We then establish the high model performance using in-sample and out-of-sample analyses and develop prescriptive models for energy-optimal runtime workload management. We present four dynamic resource management methodologies (packing, load balancing, threshold-based switching, and energy optimization), model their application at two levels (within-rack and cross-rack resource allocation), and explore runtime resource redistribution policies for jobs under the computational steering and comparatively evaluate strategies that use computational steering with those that do not. Our experimental results lead to a threshold strategy that yields near-optimal energy efficiency under all workload conditions. We further calibrate the energy-optimal resource allocations over the full range of workloads and present a bi-criteria evaluation to consider energy consumption and job performance tradeoffs. We conclude with implementation guidelines and policy insights into energy-efficient computing resource management in large supercomputing centers.},

Despite their prevalent adoption by e-commerce platforms, the effect of CGIs on customers’ postpurchase satisfaction remains unclear. We find that CGIs lead to a decline in subsequent ratings compared with product ratings not exposed to CGIs. Furthermore, high CGI review ratings and high aesthetic quality exacerbate the negative effect, whereas reviewers’ face disclosure in CGIs can alleviate the negative effect. Through cross-product analyses, we find that the negative effect is more prominent for experience goods (e.g., women’s dresses) than for search goods (e.g., lightning cables). Results from a laboratory experiment show that participants experience significantly higher expectation and negative disconfirmation when reading CGI reviews with high ratings, whereas the uncertainty reduction effect is insignificant, which collectively explains the decline of subsequent product ratings from a theoretical perspective. These findings suggest that platforms and retailers should be aware of the potential negative effect of CGIs on the rating dynamics and take appropriate measures to circumvent it.},

Whereas the production and publication of software packages fosters unprecedented levels of digital innovation, there are also drawbacks associated with software reuse (e.g., as was publicly discussed in 2021 with the discovery of the Log4Shell vulnerability). Building on previous research, our work explores the implications associated with the unprecedented scale and uncoordinated nature of packaged software reuse. We use complex adaptive systems as a generative lens to help us conceptualize the phenomenon and identify promising avenues for research and practice on this topic.

Although the literature typically considers heuristics as behavior biases, we explore how different types of heuristics differ from one another. Through peer-to-peer lending data, we observe that borrowers who use limited attention when applying for loans tend to choose round loan amounts, simplifying the decision-making process but compromising accuracy. This round-number heuristic decreases their funding success rate and increases the probability of default. On the other hand, some borrowers select loan amounts in “lucky numbers” that superstitious lenders favor. This lucky-number heuristic caters to the lenders’ preference, thus increasing the borrowers’ funding success rates and reducing the likelihood of default. Our paper demonstrates that borrowers select heuristics based on their motives, leading to varying consequences. We also show that heuristics are not all the same, and people’s choice of heuristics provides insight into their characteristics and can predict decision outcomes. For instance, factoring in heuristic usage information improves default prediction accuracy in our setting. Our findings can be beneficial to practitioners in refining the underwriting and screening of borrowers and loans.},

In collaboration with a leading online dating platform with no reputation mechanisms and where most of the information is self-disclosed, we design and conduct a randomized field experiment to examine not only who chooses to verify but also, the effectiveness of such optional verification for different types of users. We identify that a simple-to-implement mechanism, such as phone verification, when made optional can take on additional significance in platforms that lack alternate reputation and transaction-assurance mechanisms, especially for those in early years or those that lack other credible mechanisms to verify important information about participants. Our findings also provide insights into how optional verification has heterogeneous impacts on different platform users and can also facilitate desirable matching and benefit the platform as a whole, paving the way for examining other similar verification mechanisms.},

These findings imply that (1) the design of FR technology can be improved to alleviate the social presence effect (such as adding a privacy screen filter or beautify the appearance of the consumer’s image), and (2) monetary incentives may be used to attract more users by leveraging the herding effect.},

To study such interventions' effects, we examine data-protection policies that policy makers and governments can enforce on websites, including consent-based user information sharing and subsidizing competing websites. Interestingly, we find that even though a consent-based policy may improve user surplus, it has the unintended consequence of increasing the number of third-parties and, thus, sharing of user information. We also determine that both consent-based and website subsidization policies may reduce competition by driving websites out of the market—to the detriment of user surplus and social welfare. Moreover, consent-based policies are not beneficial to websites, but are beneficial for third-parties. Policy makers should consider the different policy mechanisms at their disposal. Website subsidization is similar to a scalpel, enabling them to sculpt around and impact specific target markets. Consent-based policies are more comparable to a sledgehammer that uniformly affects all market segments. For circumstances where it is difficult for the government to enact a law for the entire market, website subsidization policies may be appealing alternatives, as they may yield higher user surplus than consent-based policies.},

However, public customer engagement on social media does not come without risk. For example, negative word of mouth on social media stemming from poor customer engagement or a brand response can disseminate and reach a large audience. Despite the popularity of social media platforms as customer relationship channels, it is still unclear how a brand crisis can change a brand’s social CRM efforts. Leveraging a natural experiment setting, we investigate the impact of the United Airlines crisis on three dimensions of social CRM efforts: informativeness, timeliness, and attentiveness.

Bystanders’ joining-in behaviors reinforce the abuse, expose victims to a larger audience, and encourage further abuse by signaling their approval of the aggressive behavior. This study developed an integrative model that explains bystanders’ joining-in cyberbullying behaviors on SNSs to offer actionable insights into reducing such harmful behaviors. We tested the model using 1,179 responses using a scenario survey study. Our findings suggest that IT artifacts (including digital profile, search and privacy, relational ties, and network transparency) activated two key mechanisms that lead to cyberbullying joining-in behaviors: (i) the deindividuation experiences that attenuate self-identity and put salience on group/social identity, and (ii) the moral disengagement practices that permit the exercise of cognitive maneuvers to justify group-interested choices that do not align with social standard. The findings explain why people who do not know each other gang up to bully a target on social media. Platform owners who wish to discourage bystanders from joining in undesirable activities may consider regulating how users could share and access digital resources in a social network and should acknowledge the influence of social identity in igniting, driving, and prolonging harmful online group behaviors.},

This paper investigates how inconsistency among top reviews affects a consumer’s purchase deferral—the likelihood to decide immediately or defer the decision until after obtaining more information. We found that, if different reviewers disagree on their opinions about the same feature of a product, consumers are more likely to defer the purchase decision and consult more reviews. Further, this effect is weaker when reviewers provide specific details about their needs or use of the product along with their opinions. This work provides guidance to review platforms on how to select and present a set of top reviews. Our findings also inform retailers and product manufacturers on how to focus their attention in dealing with reviews and when a focus only on the top reviews is not sufficient.},

Interestingly, they can leverage the empowerment to adapt in two ways: maximize benefits, where they use the system to its full potential in conducting work, and minimize disturbances, where they reduce role conflict with the system in conducting work. Although inexperienced employees leverage the empowerment to use the system to its full potential, experienced employees leverage the empowerment to minimize role conflict with the system.

Text-based personality detection has garnered attention due to the public availability of digital textual traces, however state-of-the-art models proposed by IBM, Google, Facebook, and academic research are not accurate enough to be used for downstream real-world forecasting tasks. We propose a novel text-based personality measurement approach that improves detection of personality dimensions by 10–20 percentage points relative to the best existing methods developed in industry and academia. Using case studies in the finance and health domains, we show that more accurate text-based personality detection can translate into significant improvements in downstream applications such as forecasting future firm performance or predicting pandemic infection rates. Our findings have important implications for managers focused on enabling, producing, or consuming predictive analytics for enhanced agility in decision making.},

We address a new problem at the macro platform level, platform risk evaluation, and explore types of information and methods that are effective in predicting platform risk. We identify four types of information, that is, platform characteristic, risk management, commercial competition, and online word of mouth, and examine their utilities, separately and jointly, in predicting platform risk. We also propose the use of survival analysis, especially the mixture survival model, in predicting whether and when a platform will default. We carry out a cross-stage analysis using data crawled from two leading web portals for online lending in China with the two stages separated by the recent dramatic policy intervention. The results reveal the differences among the four identified factors in terms of predictive utility, the heterogeneity between the two types of default platforms, and differences between the start-up and stable periods of platform development. Based on the results, we derive some insights and examine the cross-stage changes and commonalities. We provide both lessons learned from the past and practical implications for market managers and lenders in the current online lending market.},

The Impact of Technological Acquisitions on Contributions to Open-Source Software This study examines how acquisitions of open-source software (OSS) firms may impact the internal and external contributors to the OSS projects of acquisition targets. We find that, for target firms, acquisitions hurt internal contributions from their employees to their OSS projects but attract more external contributions from outside developers. Therefore, managers of merged entities should strive to maintain the incentives of target firms’ internal developers after acquisitions, and they can also leverage acquisitions to attract external developers. We also find that acquirers with prior OSS experiences and similar OSS projects with target firms are in an advantageous position to attract contributions from both target firms’ internal developers and external developers in the OSS community. In this regard, managers of acquirers can consider building their OSS experiences and selecting appropriate target firms before acquisitions. Moreover, our study suggests that acquisitions of OSS firms can also benefit the whole OSS community by motivating the contributions of internal and external developers to other projects in the community. Therefore, for both practitioners and policy makers, acquisitions should have important implications for nourishing the entire OSS community.},

   abstract                      = {Choice overload is a common problem in many online settings, including healthcare. Online healthcare platforms tend to provide a large variety of behavior intervention information or programs to help individuals modify their lifestyles to improve wellness. However, having too many options can significantly increase searching cost, prevent users from discovering the truly relevant interventions, and harm users’ long-term healthcare decision-making efficiency. This motivates us to propose a personalized healthcare recommendation system to provide tailored support for individuals’ intervention participation. The proposed framework, a deep-learning and diversity-enhanced multiarmed bandit (DLDE-MAB), integrates several predictive and prescriptive analytics components to combat the unique challenges presented in the healthcare recommendation setting. It leverages online machine learning to provide adaptive and real-time support, a theory-guided diversity promotion scheme to cover multiple healthcare needs, and deep learning to further enhance dynamic context representation. Through extensive experiments, we show that the proposed framework outperforms various competing models in terms of its adaptivity to data dynamics, diversity, and uncertainty. The proposed model and evaluation results provide important implications for business intelligence and personalized, contextualized, and agile healthcare decision making.},

Practical strategies can be developed to facilitate the formation of the consideration sets. For example, to reduce consumers’ search costs and cognitive efforts, online retailers can display the recommended products in a descending order according to the predicted closeness of consumers’ preferences. Online retailers can further indicate the predicted closeness scores of consumers’ preferences for the recommended products. Given such a placement arrangement, consumers can quickly screen the recommended products and add the most relevant alternatives to their consideration sets, which should facilitate consumers’ shopping process and increase the shopping satisfaction. The findings also suggest that a larger consideration set due to the use of recommender systems could induce consumers to buy. Yet, it is difficult for consumers to manage many alternatives when the consideration set is very large. To facilitate consumers’ shopping process, online retailers need to consider strategies and tools that help consumers manage the alternatives in the consideration set in a better-organized manner and facilitate the comparison across the alternatives.},

Whereas the importance of catastrophe insurance to disaster preparedness is beyond dispute, catastrophe insurers are increasingly reckoning with the potential impact of inequality in insurance practices. Historically, the presence of inequalities in insurance, from redlining to pricing disparity, has had a devastating impact on minority communities. Even recently, people living in predominantly African American communities can still be charged more for the same insurance coverage than people living in other communities. Whereas the fairness of insurance ratemaking is studied in general, we identify a unique challenge for catastrophe insurance that sets it apart from other lines of insurance. Drawing upon the recent advances in machine learning for fair data valuation, we reveal striking connections between the two seemingly unrelated problems and lean on insights from machine learning to study the fairness of ratemaking methods for catastrophe insurance. Our results indicate the potential existence of disparate impact against minorities across existing methods, pointing to a unique solution that can satisfy a few commonly assumed properties of fair ratemaking for catastrophe insurance.},

In this study, we delve into solvers’ ideation process and examine how different configurations of seeker exemplars affect the quantitative outcomes in solvers’ scanning, shortlisting, and selection of ideas. Results from an online experiment show that solvers generally search for, shortlist, and/or submit fewer ideas when shown certain seeker exemplars. In addition, solvers who submit fewer ideas tend to submit lower-quality ideas, on average. Thus, a key insight from this study is that showing seeker exemplars, which contest platforms encourage and seekers often do, could negatively affect quantitative ideation outcomes and thereby impair idea quality. To help mitigate these adverse ideation outcomes, we propose a few areas of which seekers should be mindful. We also suggest ways that contests’ platforms can contribute to the idea generation process that solvers undertake.},

   abstract                      = {Recommendation systems and the decoy effect are two popular marketing techniques that have been used for facilitating decision making. Practitioners often use decoys to help drive demand for specific items, and prior research has shown the decoy effect to be robust in traditional choice settings, with consistent reporting of an overall positive impact. Recommendation systems are also increasingly being used to present item choice sets to customers and users, assisting users in their decision-making process. However, previous work has not examined the decoy effect in the context of recommendations. The decoy effect may facilitate consumer decision making and positively impact user behavior when used with recommendation systems. However, in the recommendation context, customers often have different expectations for the reliability and quality of the presented information. Hence, a decoy as a recommendation could signal issues in system reliability, resulting in a negative effect. Our study demonstrates that depending on the recommendation context, the decoy effect can be beneficial or counterproductive. Specifically, we find in the personalized context, including a decoy minimizes the demand for the target option and pushes consumers to opt out of purchase, which deviates from the traditional decoy effect. However, a decoy increases the target item’s demand in the nonpersonalized context, following the conventional decoy effect.},

To this end, we propose a theory-driven deep learning method that enables us to (1) learn customers’ personalized product preferences and dynamic satisfaction in the absence of their profile information, (2) model customers’ actual experiences based on multiview voice chat information in an interlaced way, and (3) enhance the customer response prediction performance of a black box deep learning model with theory-driven dynamic satisfaction. Empirical evaluation results demonstrate the advantageous prediction performance of our proposed method over state-of-the-art deep learning alternatives. Investigation of cumulative satisfaction reveals the collaborative predictive roles of theory-driven dynamic satisfaction and deep representation features for customer response prediction.

Furthermore, we explore how to improve the effectiveness of recommendations. We conducted a field study where we leveraged the candidate tracking system of a large recruitment firm to measure the varying impact recommendations have on recruiters’ decisions. Our findings show that OPN and non-OPN recommendations that discuss an expected weakness positively affect a candidate’s likelihood of being interviewed. In contrast, recommendations that discuss an unexpected weakness have a negative effect. Furthermore, we find that non-OPN recommendations with no discussion of weakness are significantly more effective than OPN recommendations with no discussion of weakness. We then show that the potential benefits of discussing an expected weakness are more pronounced for OPN recommendations, whereas the potential harm of discussing an unexpected weakness is more severe for non-OPN recommendations.},

Our findings show that including a discussion of weakness in a recommendation increases the perceived credibility of the recommender, which has a positive effect on the candidate’s likelihood of being interviewed.

Furthermore, we find that the physically attractive candidates (as shown in their profile picture) are harmed regardless of the weakness discussed. We investigate this further and find that additional discussion of the candidate’s strengths can reduce the negative impact of the discussion of weakness, but only if the strengths are consistent with common gender-based expectations.},

Our research provides empirical evidence that this concern is unfounded based on a state-wide study of patient visit-level data of telehealth use in 58 hospitals in Maryland from 2012 to 2021. On average, telehealth use can reduce future outpatient visits by 13.6% within 30 days after a telehealth visit, leading to a cost reduction of $239. The benefits of telehealth are most apparent for diseases with high potential for process virtualization, such as mental health, skin disorders, metabolic, and musculoskeletal diseases. Although telehealth has a substitution effect on future healthcare utilization, this effect is not observed among rural patients who use telehealth as a gateway to utilize more primary care and specialist services. Our findings suggest that policymakers should promote the use of telehealth in a value-based healthcare environment by providing monetary incentives to expand telehealth use among patients and providers, and expand the scope of telehealth services to include consultation with specialists especially among rural patients.},

In particular, we find that the addition of a donation scheme can increase the success rate of reward campaigns substantially, especially those with prosocial causes. In addition, the donation received is found to have a crowd-in effect on subsequent contributions. To get the most out of donation schemes, crowdfunding sites should provide features that help backers locate reward campaigns for prosocial causes, for example, by providing tags or search filters related to prosocial causes. Second, campaign owners should take steps to highlight the prosocial aspects of their crowdfunding campaign, for example, by revising campaign descriptions to include prosocial keywords/tags. Third, campaign owners should play a more active role in encouraging early donations to enjoy the crowd-in effect that could help their campaigns reach the targeted funding amount. Specifically, the owner’s direct social network is a potentially good source for soliciting these early donations. Relatedly, the campaign owners could benefit by spreading the word about the early donations they receive so as to generate a greater crowd-in effect at later phases of the crowdfunding process.},

Some retailers operate a hybrid and special omnichannel structure referred to as New Retail promising to tightly integrate online and physical channels. In the meanwhile, some retailers such as Ross choose to only operate physical channels. In this paper, we provide insights into competing firms’ retail-channel choices among online channel, physical channel, and omnichannel under the New Retail model. We find that firms’ channel choices determine which channels compete directly with each other and hence the intensity of competition between firms. Firms’ channel choices also give rise to three other effects-market expansion, consumer segmentation, and intrafirm cannibalization. The tradeoff among these effects along with the nature and intensity of competition determine the equilibrium channel structure in the market.},

We propose a dynamic consumer acquisition model to enable value-driven acquisition decisions. We build a model of consumer acquisition that takes into account the value that a consumer contributes to the recommender system, the cost of their participation (e.g., privacy loss), and the value of their participation to other consumers (via network externality). We also propose data-driven procedures to estimate this model to enable informed, value-driven acquisition decisions. On three different data sets, we perform comprehensive simulation-based evaluations to demonstrate the performance of this dynamic consumer acquisition model. We find nuanced relationships between the firm’s choice of incentive strategies and acquisition outcomes. Neither a constant pricing strategy nor a greedy pricing strategy may be optimal. Instead, under a moderately greedy strategy, where the firm only partially extracts the network externality from consumers, the dynamic acquisition sequence can outperform random acquisition sequences on firm utility, recommender system performance, and consumer surplus simultaneously. Our work contributes a novel theoretical framework, practical insights, and design artifacts to facilitate effective consumer acquisition in recommender systems.},

   abstract                      = {Practice and Policy-Oriented Abstract Law enforcement bodies have largely responded to the increase in darknet activities through site shutdowns, which involve significant investment of policing resources. Despite these efforts, new darknet sites continue to show up after the site takedowns. We offer a new look at this issue by assessing the viability of selectively targeting large drug vendors operating on darknet sites. We find that the arrest of a major drug vendor reduced subsequent transaction levels by 39% and the number of remaining vendors by 56% on Silk Road 2.0. This deterrent effect also spilled over to drug vendors located in countries beyond the prosecutorial jurisdiction of the arrested vendor. We further find that small darknet drug vendors were most deterred by the arrest and vendors selling dangerous drugs were relatively more deterred. Our study findings hold policy-relevant implications to government agencies and law enforcement. Whereas site shutdowns can disrupt these markets momentarily, the selective targeting of large-scale drug vendors should be given serious consideration and used to a broader extent. The design of future enforcement strategies should also account for the finding that darknet markets are made up of both small-scale drug dealers new to the drug trade and large-scale drug syndicates.},

Training fresh models for the task is risky (there are new model biases to understand), time consuming (you will need to see many examples to predict new examples), and cost-ineffective. We propose an approach that prioritizes the evolution and representation of radical ideas by creating a computer program to explicitly keep track of ideologies. We show how this program uses state-of-the art deep-learning models to create human and machine-readable representations of radical ideologies by automatically consuming content symbolic of those ideologies. Our approach validates the notion that violent ideologies differ in content but are homogenous in structure. With just a few examples of content, the program creates powerful representations that can be used to automatically detect additional content with surprising accuracy. This process greatly reduces the time and resources necessary to adapt existing content-labeling models to the changing ideological and rhetorical landscape.},

Although inherently important, the response of scored individuals to such algorithmic transparency is understudied. Inspired by psychological and economic theories of information processing, we aim to fill this gap. We conducted a comprehensive empirical study to explore how and why disclosing the use of algorithmic scoring processes to (involuntarily) scored individuals affects their behaviors. Our results provide strong evidence that the disclosure of fundamentally erroneous algorithmic scores evokes self-fulfilling prophecies that endogenously steer the behavior of scored individuals toward their assessment, enabling algorithms to help produce the world they predict. Our results emphasize that isolated transparency measures can have considerable side effects with noticeable implications for the development of automation bias, the occurrence of feedback loops, and the design of transparency regulations.},

We also found that four media capabilities (transmission velocity, parallelism, symbol sets, and reprocessability) have strong influence on both connectivity and communality. These findings suggest that managers of OCs should add software capabilities that help OC members find like-minded members, enable instant messaging among members, and provide richer communication beyond simple text messages.},

Because of the deeply consequential nature of professional services and the large information asymmetries between customers and service providers, designing effective risk-reduction strategies is crucial for facilitating digital transactions of professional services. This paper studies whether and how the introduction of a novel risk-reduction strategy, the add-on insurance covering the potential cost of negative consequences (e.g., complications and unsatisfactory outcomes), affects the demand for professional services in online platforms. We leverage a policy change in an online platform for cosmetic procedures, which started to offer the add-on insurance for a subset of procedures in 2016. Our empirical analysis shows that the introduction of insurance increases the sales of low-risk procedures, but not those of high-risk ones. More importantly, the insurance has a negative spillover effect on uninsured competitors, regardless of their risk levels. The negative spillover effect on high-risk procedures is noteworthy because it hurts the sales of their uninsured competitors without increasing their own sales, reducing the overall demand. Our findings have important implications for platforms to design, deploy, and evaluate their risk-reduction strategies.},

The authors demonstrate that extending the magnitude of taste differentiation is an effective differentiation strategy. Quality differentiation, however, is a double-edged sword and should be used with care.

In this study, we consider how the introduction of P2P lending platforms, and the resulting access to capital, influences local abortion rates, a medical procedure characterized by significant financial barriers and social stigma. We find that the entry of the P2P platform LendingClub is associated with an increase in the rate at which women choose to not carry to term. We argue that the availability of capital through these platforms, when combined with privacy protections, is able to reduce the financial barriers women face when accessing abortion services. This observed effect is stronger in more religious areas and areas with lower levels of education, indicating that social frictions and stigma may be higher in these areas, and also showing where providing an additional channel for funding is more influential.},

In the case of product ratings, if only people who favor the product provide ratings while others put aside the product and do not respond, then even a simple mean estimation of the product rating would be significantly biased. Such bias challenges the validity of data analysis, and it cannot be eliminated simply by increasing the sample size of the data. To correct the bias arising from nonrandom missing values, it is necessary to examine and model what causes the missing values. We propose and demonstrate the superior performance of a Monte Carlo likelihood approach to correct the bias. Overall, we recommend well-designed data collection processes with documentation of the possible reasons for missing values, cautious adoption of missing value handling methods, and structured missing value reporting practices.},

Upon decomposition of news article sentiment, we find a contrasting positive author sentiment effect and a negative news topic valence effect on news readership.

   abstract                      = {Online learning is of growing importance to institutions and learners, and the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored its importance even more. Because learner autonomy is relatively high in these online environments, they must engage in self-regulated learning processes to achieve successful learning outcomes, but studies show that most learners are not able to do so. Hence, in this longitudinal field experiment, using a massively open online course (MOOCs), a type of online learning environment, we investigate whether gamified interventions through the learning platform can foster learners to engage in self-regulated learning processes and improve their learning outcomes. We find that gamification interventions are indeed useful, but for these gamification interventions to succeed, they must be designed to provide personalized feedback to learners that match with their learning goal-orientation. Overall, our findings point to the fact that gamification designs in online learning platforms can enhance learners’ engagement and learning outcomes, but they must be personalized. A one-size-fits-all approach to gamification design in online learning just does not work and may even backfire to reduce the engagement of some learners.},

Whereas this type of research allows us to understand the strength and direction of the treatment effect under different conditions, it does not directly speak to the generative mechanisms, namely, why and how the effect arises. A standard procedure to identify the mechanisms underlying a treatment effect is mediation analysis, but extant mediation analysis frameworks either have no causal interpretation or require the mediators to be unconfounded. Because mediators typically cannot be preassigned beforehand, their endogeneity remains a serious concern even in randomized experiments. This paper presents a flexible endogenous mediation analysis framework that still has causal interpretation when the mediator is endogenous. We discuss the identification conditions for different types of endogenous mediators, including unobserved or partially observed ones, under this framework. We show that endogenous mediation models can be parametrically identified without an instrumental variable when the generating process of the mediator is nonlinear. We further examine how the identification strengths of these models vary with a series of factors. Finally, we provide guidelines on when and how to use endogenous mediation analysis. We offer an R package that implements the proposed models.},

Second, the latent topics discovered by the novel supervised deep topic model are more accurate, which improves the performance of downstream econometrics and predictive analytics that utilize latent topics as inputs. Given the prevalence of auxiliary data in real-world text analysis tasks and the wide adoption of topic modeling in business research and practice, the study offers an effective solution for extracting insights from text data.},

Although we know about the causes of addictions, particularly those related to individual differences, recent evidence suggests that addiction evolves gradually over time and is rooted in shared characteristics of users and technology. This paper provides a longitudinal perspective over how and why hedonic information systems (IS) use addiction develops. Based on our analysis, we break down this process into three phases characterized by different types of use, whether nominal, compulsive, or addicted. Each phase highlights salient psychological needs that motivate, technology features that enable, and affordances that are actualized into each type of use. We also provide a detailed account of individuals’ self-control mechanisms, explaining how deficiencies in sensing, comparing, or regulating behavior facilitate one’s transition toward addiction. These insights are applicable to other hedonic IS that are similar in terms of ubiquity and constant access through mobile apps. They point to heterogeneous (preventive or intervening) strategies that can be used to help people regain their control over use, depending on where they are in their trajectory toward addicted use. Our findings carry implications for the design of systems and features that can help reduce the likelihood of addiction development.},

We find that informal payments can have a crowding-out effect on doctors’ intrinsic motivation to engage in medical consultations. We also find that monetary and nonmonetary gifts play distinct roles in motivating doctor responses, with nonmonetary gifts having a more significant carryover effect on follow-up interactions and better promoting the doctor-patient relationship. Our findings additionally suggest that social status moderates the impact of digital gifting on doctor engagement.

Also, the relationship between direct phone communication and ex post transaction satisfaction is stronger when a relatively more unique alternative is chosen. Direct communication enables consumers to collect additional information that supplements online observable product features and supports choice decisions. It allows consumers to anchor less on the centers of their consideration sets and select those unique alternatives. Consumers can better leverage the breadth of their consideration sets and overcome the limits of online information, eventually resulting in desirable matching outcomes.

Our study addresses this gap by identifying the importance of task characteristics and incentive alignment in successful collaboration. Through three large-scale field experiments, we find that tasks with high difficulty and urgency are suitable for collaboration, whereas collaboration can be detrimental to tasks that don’t require urgent completion. We also find that aligning individual incentives with organizational goals is critical to successful collaboration. Our research offers practical guidance to organizations implementing information systems for collaborative problem solving.

   abstract                      = {This study proposes a method to reduce the cost for acquiring impressions for location-based, mobile advertising firms. Such firms act on behalf of advertisers to execute mobile, in-app, ad campaigns. Ad space is sold on ad exchanges that auction impressions one-at-a-time, on a real-time basis. In this paper, we examine whether ad firms should work with one or multiple ad exchanges to minimize the total procurement cost (equal to the cost incurred to acquire impressions plus the computing cost). By working with more ad exchanges, the ad delivery firm can bid lower on each exchange and potentially save on the total procurement cost. However, ad exchanges typically require ad firms to spend a minimum amount on the exchange. Hence, it is not smart to work with an exchange but acquire very few impressions from this exchange. Working with multiple exchanges also incurs a higher computing cost, corresponding to the computing capacity needed to support the bidding architecture. We solve an optimization problem to determine the optimal number of ad exchanges to use to acquire impressions and the optimal bidding policy on each of these exchanges. We also propose a novel, selective bidding strategy where some bid requests are returned with a zero bid. That is, the ad firm deliberately passes on some opportunities to win impressions. Doing so reduces the computing cost (because returning a zero bid expends minimal computing resources). However, the firm needs to bid higher on other opportunities to meet its demand. We find the optimal selective bidding strategy in addition to the optimal number of ad exchanges and the optimal bidding strategy when non-zero bids are returned. Finally, we demonstrate our solution for a real ad firm (Cidewalk) where the firm is shown to reduce its total cost by 33% by working with multiple ad exchanges (instead of working with a single ad exchange) and the use of selective bidding (instead of returning a nonzero bid for every bid request).},

Our fine-grained data are based on the universe of phone calls made in a European country between January and July 2016. We isolate social influence from observed and latent homophily by taking advantage of the rich spatial-temporal information and the social interactions available from the longitudinal behavioral data. We find that influence stemming from phone communication is significant and persists up to four degrees of separation in the communication network. Building on this finding, we introduce a new “influence” centrality measure that captures the empirical pattern of influence decay over successive connections. A validation test shows that the average influence centrality of the adopters at the beginning of each observational period can strongly predict the number of eventual adopters and has a stronger predictive power than other prevailing centrality measures. Our centrality measure can be used to improve optimal seeding strategies in contexts with influence over phone calls, such as targeted or viral marketing campaigns.},

This study investigates how informal payments in the form of monetary gifts affect doctor engagement, using the launch of a gifting feature by a leading OHC as a natural experiment that exogenously provides doctors with extra monetary incentives. We find that informal payments can have a crowding-out effect on doctors’ intrinsic motivation to engage in medical consultations. We also find that monetary and nonmonetary gifts play distinct roles in motivating doctor responses, with nonmonetary gifts having a more significant carryover effect on follow-up interactions and better promoting the doctor-patient relationship. Our findings additionally suggest that social status moderates the impact of digital gifting on doctor engagement. These findings provide useful implications for online health communities that have implemented or are planning to implement digital gifting to stimulate user engagement.},

Although people generally self-report privacy to be important to them, in practice they often disclose far more private information than their self-reported privacy preferences. This “privacy paradox” could be better understood by uncovering the neural processes underlying the privacy calculus: weighing the risks against the benefits of disclosure. We assess the neural processes shaping privacy tradeoffs to characterize the neural mechanisms underlying privacy tradeoffs to design behavioral interventions that help people make better decisions that align with their privacy preferences. In Study 1, we used functional MRI (fMRI) to identify the neural correlates of the privacy calculus. In Study 2, we leveraged brain insights to design and test a neurally informed behavioral intervention to help people protect their privacy. Our results show that altering the timing when information is presented precisely at the time of decision (specifically within a second) directs attention to privacy risks versus benefits, therefore discouraging participants from disclosing their private information. Identifying the neural processes of privacy helps elucidate the privacy calculus and sheds light on the privacy paradox and guides the design of neurally informed behavioral interventions to help people protect their privacy.},

Our study addresses this gap by identifying the importance of task characteristics and incentive alignment in successful collaboration. Through three large-scale field experiments, we find that tasks with high difficulty and urgency are suitable for collaboration, whereas collaboration can be detrimental to tasks that don’t require urgent completion. We also find that aligning individual incentives with organizational goals is critical to successful collaboration. Our research offers practical guidance to organizations implementing information systems for collaborative problem solving. We suggest using task characteristics to determine the workflow that will benefit from a collaborative approach.

Helpful reviews qualified by such simple indicators, however, may not necessarily yield accurate sales predictions, owing to the ever-evolving review information quality, customer demand, and product attributes. Positing that reviews with higher customer attention should be more influential to customers’ purchase intention and product sales, we propose to leverage customer attention to better realize the potential of multimodal reviews for sales prediction. We conceptualize customer attention at the holistic review set, review subset, individual review, and review element levels, respectively, and induce four indicators of customer attention, that is, timeliness, semantic diversity, voting-awareness, and varying multimodal interaction. We then propose a novel deep learning method, which incorporates these customer attention indicators using neural network attention mechanisms specifically designed for multimodal-review-based sales prediction. Empirical evaluation based on a large data set in a case study predicting hotel sales (specifically, monthly occupancy rate) shows that, in terms of both prediction performance and representation learning performance, our proposed method outperformed benchmarked state-of-the-art deep learning methods. As multimodal reviews become increasingly prevalent, this method serves as a tool for adequately leveraging such multimodal data to support business decision making.},

Utilizing a unique data set from a leading bank in Asia that records credit card transactions of its customers before and after the launch of Alipay mobile payment, the largest mobile payment platform in the world, this study aims to understand the impact of mobile payment adoption on bank customer credit card activities and the change of this impact after the mobile payment expansion. To do so, we employ the difference-in-differences method coupled with matching to estimate the effects. We find that mobile payment adoption not only increases customer credit card activities at the focal bank through both off-line and online channels, but also enhances customer loyalty to the bank by reducing churn. Specifically, the total credit card transaction amount and frequency of our focal bank increased by 9.4% and 10.7%, respectively. Moreover, we examine the change in the treatment effect after the mobile payment expansion and find an increase in adopters’ credit card activities and a reduction in their churn after the expansion. Next, we discuss the underlying mechanisms and show that mobile payment acts as a substitute for physical card payment in the off-line channel, and this supports the key underlying mechanism of the reduced transaction cost. However, a certain complementary effect exists between personal computer and mobile payments, likely driven by the coadoption of the two. Finally, we provide empirical evidence on conditions that facilitate the use of mobile payments, following the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology.

Second, we shift our focus to the breadth of software patent protection rather than the quantity of patents held by a firm. Third, we provide evidence showing increased open-source involvement and sales for software firms when software patent protection is more limited. Put simply, a more restricted scope of software patent protection could foster a beneficial situation for both software firms and society. Despite less reliance on formal patent protection, companies can still generate and profit from their innovations without excluding societal members from utilizing these advancements. This “less-is-more” approach may extend to a wider array of software-related innovations, including but not limited to artificial intelligence, blockchain, and other emerging digital technologies.},

We are particularly interested in the phenomenon of geoconquesting: the bottom-of-funnel advertising efforts of a firm to poach (or lure away) customers that have come to a competing firm’s physical store as a result of top-of-funnel advertising efforts by the firm. Geoconquesting efforts by a competing firm should reduce a focal firm’s incentive to invest in top-of-funnel efforts. Thus, a key challenge for an agent like Google that provides both top-of-funnel and bottom-of-funnel advertising services, is to balance the inherent conflict between the two in order to maximize the total revenue collected from the two forms of advertising. We develop a game-theoretic model to study the this phenomenon. A key result is that sometimes the agent benefits from not offering geoconquesting, but instead promises, after collecting a fee, to protect the advertisers from poaching on each other’s search traffic. Interestingly, such a protection service becomes more lucrative for the agent when a cheaper outside option for geoconquesting is available to the advertisers.},

They fail to attend to important aspects of how humans make judgments on the veracity of an argument, creating important challenges.

The two experiments for testing model performance and explainability reveal that our framework shows stronger performance and better explainability, outperforming cutting-edge machine learning methods and presenting positive effects on human task performance, trust in algorithms, and confidence in decision making.

Given that DP owners do not possess formal power over the sides (they are free to join other DPs simultaneously), our study demonstrates how a DP owner, in addition to putting in place structures to enable or constrain certain actions of platform sides, must also influence their narrowing of possibilities of action toward achieving coordinated actions. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to offer a process model of digital platform coordination that explains digital platform coordination in terms of the contextual conditions (when platform sides could enact their agency), the mechanisms of the platform sides’ agency enactment and digital orienting (an expanded repertoire of actions in coordinating platform sides through technology), and the resultant outcome.},

Long-term training programs should be established to equip less-educated workers with the necessary skills to navigate technological changes.

By analyzing a representative sample of providers, we first establish the Compact entry shock’s validity and its positive effect on the supply of medical services. We then report evidence that there are service and payment shifts from rural providers to urban providers (i.e., urban providers are more likely to benefit from the Compact entry financially). Relying on patients’ telehealth reimbursement claim data, we observe two mechanisms contributing to the revenue redistribution: the substitution and gateway effects of telehealth. Finally, we show that telehealth readiness and service quality moderate the impact of telehealth adoption. These findings speak to both potentially positive and negative consequences for welfare.},

   abstract                      = {The growing online retail market has led to the prevalence of multichannel retailing. Meanwhile, retailers are increasingly combining multichannel retailing with a multibranding strategy. Although this can further increase the retailer’s sales, it brings new advertising challenges. Multibrand, multichannel retailers usually launch advertising campaigns for different brands on multiple media. Thus, their advertising efforts fall into a set of brand-media units. Each unit’s advertising can affect the sales of all brands on all channels. To maximize the advertising returns, a retailer needs to coordinate the advertising expenditures on different units. We develop a stochastic differential equation model that helps the retailer estimate the impact of multimedia advertising on the sales of different brands on different channels. Afterward, we formulate the advertising optimization problems under four coordination strategies: noncoordination, brand coordination, media coordination, and global coordination. By solving the problem for each strategy, the retailers can obtain the optimal expenditure for each unit under that strategy. Finally, we compare the retailer’s profits under four strategies. Interestingly, we find that brand or media coordination may result in a profit lower than noncoordination. Our findings provide insights regarding the selection of coordination strategies for multibrand, multichannel retailers with multimedia advertising campaigns.},

   abstract                      = {To leverage the complementary strengths of humans and artificial intelligence (AI) in online service encounters, firms have begun to use hybrid service agents: combinations of AI agents (e.g., chatbots) and human agents (e.g., service employees) behind a single interface. However, it is unclear whether firms should be transparent about behind-the-scenes employees working in tandem with an AI-based chatbot to serve customers. Against this backdrop, we investigated the impact of human involvement disclosure on customer interactions with hybrid service agents. Our findings suggest that disclosing human involvement before or during an interaction with the hybrid service agent leads customers to adopt a more human-oriented communication style. This effect is driven by impression management concerns that are activated when customers become aware of humans working in tandem with the chatbot. The more human-oriented communication style ultimately increases employee workload because fewer customer requests can be handled automatically by the chatbot and must be delegated to a human. These findings provide novel insights into how and why disclosing human involvement affects customer communication behavior, reveal its negative consequences for employees working in tandem with a chatbot, and highlight the potential costs and benefits of providing transparency in customer–hybrid service agent interactions.},

   abstract                      = {Clocking-in cash-back (CIC), an emerging gamified business model in online learning, has recently garnered significant attention. CIC allows users to secure a full refund of the course fee through consecutive completion of specific tasks within a required time window. These tasks, known as clocking in, encompass activities such as daily assignments and sharing progress updates on social media. By employing this gamification system, the firm effectively monitors user efforts, categorizing them as winners or quitters based on clocking-in completion. In this paper, we examine how a firm should set the optimal time window for its course and how the time window is affected by context-specific factors. We identify two opposing effects associated with extending the time window on users’ quitting time: the psychological disutility increasing effect (negative) and the effort cost decreasing effect (positive). Our results indicate that, as quitters’ positive word-of-mouth effects increase, there are cases in which the firm should opt for shortening the time window. Additionally, we find that, as the marginal content creation cost rises, the firm may find it more advantageous to raise the difficulty level by shortening the time window. Our findings provide valuable insights that online learning firms can utilize to enhance their design of the CIC mechanism.},

   abstract                      = {With the growing popularity of e-commerce, nearly every prominent retailer is aiming to turn omni-channel. One crucial decision in this pursuit is the identification of the joint assortment. In this study, we contribute by examining joint assortment and product prices for a retailer that sells products through both brick-and-mortar and online channels. Our analysis indicates that the optimal assortment should be thought of as a portfolio of two types of products: customized and omni-channel. Customized products are priced in such a way that they are targeted toward customers who prefer to shop from the channel the products are sold through. In contrast, omni-channel products are priced attractively so that all customers consider buying them. The relative mix of these products depends on how flexible customers are in shopping from the channel they do not prefer and the number of customers who prefer each channel. Additionally, we investigate whether the conventional wisdom of selling niche products through the online channel is always optimal. We find that this suggestion may be sub-optimal when the online channel has greater cost of including a product in the assortment and fewer preferring customers compared with the brick-and-mortar channel.},

This research introduces an innovative approach that proactively determines the optimal quantities of resources that should be requested by local agencies. This determination is based on both current and anticipated demands, thereby ensuring a more efficient and effective response to disasters. The approach first utilizes a method that combines deep learning and temporal point process for predicting irregularly spaced future demands, and then, it formulates the resource allocation problem faced with randomly arrived demands as a stochastic optimization model. The superiority of this approach over existing resource allocation methods is demonstrated using both real-world data and simulated scenarios. The findings highlight the need for a shift from reactive to proactive strategies. Moreover, the research emphasizes the potential of advanced techniques, such as deep learning and stochastic optimization, in disaster management. These techniques can provide valuable tools for policy makers and practitioners in the field, enabling them to make more informed and effective decisions. Policies that encourage the adoption of such optimized resource allocation strategies could lead to more effective disaster response operations.},

Examining Content Coordination and Social Media Engagement During Disasters Practice- and policy-oriented abstract: Disaster relief organizations (DROs) use social media to share information rapidly and broadly. Many DROs maintain multiple accounts on the same social media platform. Each account represents a different operational entity of a DRO, such as its national headquarters or a local branch. An important problem that DROs with multiple accounts face is how to coordinate the production of social media content across these accounts. One strategy is to have all accounts within the same DRO match their decisions about how content is created and designed (e.g., audience, topic). An alternate strategy is to mismatch these decisions. Using Twitter data collected in partnership with the Canadian Red Cross, we analyze which coordination strategy is best for social media engagement. Our results suggest that, during the immediate aftermath of a disaster, accounts within the same DRO should produce content with similar characteristics by matching their content creation decisions. This leads to a 4.3% lift in engagement. However, when DROs start working on helping impacted communities recover from disasters, engagement is 29.6% higher when their accounts mismatch their content creation decisions and post distinctive content.},

   abstract                      = {We develop a framework to measure the value of free goods and services available on the internet. The conventional method of measuring consumer surplus based on monetary expenditures is ineffective because these goods’ prices are predominantly zero. As the saying goes, time is money, and thus, our method addresses this challenge by quantifying the value of the time that consumers devote to consuming these free goods. We apply our model to data on the allocation of individuals’ time among internet, television, leisure, and work, and this enables us to estimate the consumer surplus of free goods. We find that the average incremental welfare gain from the internet for each year between 2002 and 2011 was about $38 billion per year in the United States, which is equivalent to approximately 0.29% of the annual GDP. In contrast, if we had not considered the value of time, then the estimated annual incremental welfare gain would have been only $2.7 billion, which is barely 7% of the estimate derived from our model, which considers the time spent on consuming these goods. Our approach can be readily extended to the valuation of other zero-priced goods and services, such as television. In addition, our results show the importance of not only quantity but also quality (e.g., internet speed) in determining the welfare contributions of free goods.},

We find that these platforms lead to an immediate and lasting increase in the female employment rate, with a notable increase in the female employment rate by 6.5%. The economic benefits derived from this rise in female employment account for 0.27% to the country’s GDP, or 17 times the revenue of the online food delivery platform. Our analysis shows that such digital platforms offer a pathway for women to break free from traditional household roles, thus granting them more time and the opportunity to decide whether to join the labor market or stay at home. The freedom to be able to join the labor force promotes gender equality and fosters economic engagement. Policymakers need to recognize such indirect effects of technology-driven business models because they shape labor markets and drive economic outcomes. This research has vital implications for practice and policy, offering fresh perspectives on fostering female labor force participation and boosting economic growth. Empowering individual households and granting women greater agency can have profound effects, supplementing organizational measures. The study highlights the underestimated economic and societal value created by innovative technology platforms, emphasizing the need for policymakers to consider these spillover effects when assessing and regulating such platforms. Leveraging digital platforms can lead countries toward a more inclusive and prosperous future, dismantling barriers and promoting gender equality.},
